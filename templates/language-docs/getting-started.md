This page will walk a new end-user through the process of installing the API,
SDK, and a console exporter along with a brief code snippet/"hello world!".

## Installation

How to add the API, SDK, and an exporter to a project, and how to import it.

If the language offers automatic instrumentation, then the instructions on how
to install that should also go in this section.

## Initialization and Configuration

This section should demonstrate provider and basic exporter configurations,
along with a brief explanation of required defaults or best practices.

### Creating a Tracer Provider

### Creating a Metric Provider

As the metrics API remains unstable, metrics documentation can be deferred

### Creating a Console Exporter

## Quick Start

This should be a basic example of installing and configuring the API and SDK.

If automatic instrumentation is available through code imports (such as library
wrapper or monkeypatching), this should also be included.
