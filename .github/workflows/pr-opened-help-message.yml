              Please make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/). 
                
              We will run some checks on your PR. If they fail, take a look in to our [guide on pr-checks](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/pr-checks/). 
              Most issues can be resolved by running \`npm run fix:all\` locally and pushing the changes. 
              But please note that it is not your responsibility to fix all the issues. We will help you with that. 
                
              If you have any questions, feel free to ask.`
