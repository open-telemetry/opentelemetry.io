<!--
Please provide a meaningful description of what your changes will do. Bonus points for including links to related issues, other PRs, or technical references.

A detailed description helps reviewers understand the context of your change and reduces
the time needed to review.

Please make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/).

We run checks on all PRs. If a check fails on your PR, look for the fix in our [guide](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/pr-checks/).
Most issues can be resolved by running `npm run fix:all` locally and pushing the changes.
But please note that it is not your responsibility to fix these issues. We will help you.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
