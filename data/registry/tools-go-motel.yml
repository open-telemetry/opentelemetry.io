description: |
  motel generates synthetic OpenTelemetry signals (traces, metrics,
  and logs) from a YAML topology definition. Describe your distributed system
  architecture and motel produces faithful telemetry without requiring live
  services. Import real traces to reverse-engineer topologies, simulate failures
  and latency spikes with time-windowed scenarios, and choose from traffic
  patterns including diurnal, Poisson, and bursty.
