description: OddDotNet is a Test Harness for OpenTelemetry that works for any
  language, built in .NET. It is a container image that accepts OpenTelemetry
  signals over gRPC, and it includes a query language for verifying and
  validating those signals.

  OddDotNet enables automated Observability Driven Development, hence where it
  gets its name.
