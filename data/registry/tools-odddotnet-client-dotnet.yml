  OddDotNet is an Test Harness for OpenTelemetry that works for any language, built in .NET. It is a container image that accepts OpenTelemetry signals over gRPC, and it includes a query language for verifying and validating those signals.
  While it's possible to generate your own client using the proto files, it is often more convenient to use a pre-compiled package installed from NuGet. This client library for .NET also includes the opentelemetry-proto clients to allow for manually generating and sending signals, and lastly it includes a query builder to ease the process of building queries using the OddQueryLanguage (OQL).
  The proto files that this project depends on can be found at https://github.com/OddDotNet/OddDotProto.
