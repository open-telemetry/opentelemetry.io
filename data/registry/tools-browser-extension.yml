  A highly-configurable browser extension that automatically instruments webpages with OpenTelemetry (which avoids any webpage CSP issues!).
  Very similar to the archived "OpenTelemetry Browser Extension Autoinjection", but with a few more features and a slightly different approach to content-script injection.
