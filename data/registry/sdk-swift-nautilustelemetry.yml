description:
  NautilusTelemetry is an iOS-oriented Swift package to collect OpenTelemetry
  data and submit it in OTLP-JSON format to an OpenTelemetry Collector instance.
  gRPC is not currently supported in order to keep the package size as small as
  possible. Not all features of OpenTelemetry are supported, and this package
  should be considered experimental.
