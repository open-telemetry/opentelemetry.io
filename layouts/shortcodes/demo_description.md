The [official OpenTelemetry
Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) is a reference
application showing how to use OpenTelemetry in a real-world environment.

The demo does the following:

* Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
* Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
* Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.

If you find yourself asking questions like:

* How do I consider the
  [architecture](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/docs/current_architecture.md)
  of a system using OpenTelemetry?
* How should I use the SDK for my language?
* What's the best way to use OpenTelemetry APIs?
* How should my services be configured?
* How should my OpenTelemetry Collector be configured?
