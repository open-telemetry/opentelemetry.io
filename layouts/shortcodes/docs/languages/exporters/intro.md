Usage: [langID]

Argument is an optional language ID (like go or cpp). When omitted, and this
shortcode is called from a docs/language page, $lang will be set to the language
ID of that page's section. For example $lang will be "cpp" for
"docs/languages/cpp/...".

Note: until https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/6582 is
fixed, $lang will be `net` for .Net. After that issue is fixed, we'll be able to
eliminate $langIdAsPath and just use $lang.

We may also be able to avoid having the `name` in the data file, instead picking
it up from the language section index file.
