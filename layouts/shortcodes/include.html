{{/*

Use to include markdown snippets. Note that the included content can have calls
to shortcodes. Arguments to this shortcode can be named or positional.

The first argument (optionally named "file") is mandatory, it is the path to the
file to include. The path is relative to the content directory. Search will be
done in '_includes' folders unless the argument starts with a dot or slash.

The value of other positional or named arguments will be used to replace
occurrences of '{{ $key }}' in the included content, where 'key' is the name of
the argument or its position in the list of positional arguments.
