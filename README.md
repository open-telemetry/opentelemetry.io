This is the source repository for the [OpenTelemetry][] website, project
documentation and blog. The site is [built][contributing.md] using [Hugo][] and
hosted on [Netlify][].

## Get involved

If you are new to OpenTelemetry and just get started with it, you are in a
perfect position to help us get better: the website and documentation is the
entry point for newcomers like you, so if something is unclear or something is
missing [let us know][]!

Read on to learn about other ways on how you can help.

Anyone can write a blog post and submit it for review by following our
[guidelines for blog posts](./CONTRIBUTING-BLOG-POSTS.md).
