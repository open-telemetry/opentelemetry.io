This is the source repository for the [OpenTelemetry][] website, project
documentation, and blog. The site is [built][contributing.md] using [Hugo][] and
is hosted on [Netlify][].

## Get involved

To learn how to contribute fixes and new content to this project, read the
[Contributor's guide](/content/en/docs/contributing), which includes a style
guide and useful information on the review process.

If you are new to OpenTelemetry and just get started with it, you are in a
perfect position to help us get better: the website and documentation is the
entry point for newcomers like you, so if something is unclear or something is
missing [let us know][].
