This is the source repo for the [OpenTelemetry][] website, project documentation
and blog. The site is [built][contributing.md] using [Hugo][] and hosted on
[Netlify][].

## Get involved

If you are new to OpenTelemetry and just get started with it, you are in a
perfect position to help us get better: the website and documentation is the
entry point for newcomers like you, so if something is unclear or something is
missing [let us know][]!

Read on to learn about other ways on how you can help.

## Adding a project to the OpenTelemetry Registry

Do you maintain or contribute to an integration for OpenTelemetry? We'd love to
feature your project in the [registry][]!

To add your project, submit a [pull request][]. You'll need to create a data
file in [data/registry][] for your project. You can find a template in
[templates/registry-entry.yml][].

## Submitting a blog post

You can submit a blog post either by forking this repository and writing it
locally or by using the GitHub UI. In both cases we ask you to follow the
instructions provided by the [blog post template](archetypes/blog.md).

**Note**: Before writing a blog post, please ask yourself, if your content also
might be a good addition to the documentation. If the answer is yes, create a
new issue/PR with your content to get it added to the docs.

### Fork & Write locally

Follow the [setup instructions][contributing.md] then, to create a skeletal blog
post, run the following command from the repo root:

```sh
npx hugo new content/en/blog/2023/short-name-for-post.md
```

If your post will have images or other assets, instead run:

```sh
npx hugo new content/en/blog/2023/short-name-for-post/index.md
```

Edit the markdown file at the path you provided in the previous
command. The file is initialized from the blog-post starter under
[archetypes](archetypes).

Put assets, if any, like images into the folder created.

Once your post is ready, submit it through a [pull request][].

### Using the Github UI

- Go to the [blog post template](archetypes/blog.md) and click on
  `Copy raw content` at the top right of the menu
- [Create a new file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/new/main)
- Paste the content from the template
- Name your file, e.g.
  `content/en/blog/2022/short-name-for-your-blog-post/index.md`
- Start editing the markdown file
- Once your post is ready click on `Propose changes` at the bottom.
