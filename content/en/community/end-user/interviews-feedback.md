One of the core functions of the OpenTelemetry End User Working Group is to
improve the project by gathering feedback from end users and sharing them with
the appropriate SIGs to help drive prioritization of improvements and changes to
the project.

Direct interview or feedback sessions between an organization and the
OpenTelemetry Community is one such resource. In these hour-long sessions, we
learn about the organization's OTel adoption and implementation, with particular
interest in the following:

- Special use cases
- Challenges with implementation -- what went well? What needs improvement?
  These can be anything, from instrumentation to documentation.
- Challenges with adoption within the organization -- how can the Community help
  you drive adoption with your teams?

We will then take the feedback you shared and turn them into actionable tasks
for the relevant SIGs, as well as provide context and insight for you during the
session as appropriate.

We schedule these sessions once a month, usually during one of the end-user
working group's meetings (alternating Thursdays at 10AM Pacific Time), but can
set up a different time if that does not work for you. The sessions are
typically attended by a few project maintainers and/or Governance Committee
members, as well as some curious general members of the Community.

Things to keep in mind:

- These sessions are recorded. However, if your organization has compliance
  concerns, we can delete them once we've summarized the notes and feedback.
- We will write up a summary post for the OpenTelemetry blog. Our goal with
  these is to drive awareness and adoption of the software, and to chronicle
  interesting use cases. These can be anonymized if your org has compliance
  concerns.
- These are open to the public, so other users may come and ask you questions.
