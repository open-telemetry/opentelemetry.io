You don‚Äôt have to become a contributor to have influence in OpenTelemetry. Just
by showing up with your perspective as an end user, you‚Äôre helping shape the
future of the project. The OTel maintainers and contributors are deeply invested
in building a project that meets real-world needs, and they need your input,
regardless if you work in a giant corp, tiny startup, or you are just hacking in
your garage.

Different people prefer different ways to share their feedback and learn from each other. Some like to have a conversation, others prefer responding to a survey, for others giving a üëç is enough. We have them all covered.

## Give thumbs up

If you encounter a bug, unexpected behavior, or a limitation, reporting it is
one of the most effective ways to help improve the project.

First, review the OpenTelemetry issues to see if anyone already reported it
before you. Giving a thumbs up or sharing more context in a comment is exactly
what we‚Äôre looking for. Are you the first person who bumped into this problem?
File an issue in one of our repositories.

## Chat on Slack

Questions, clarifications, or observations do not fit well into issues but are
just as important. You can voice them in OpenTelemetry related channels in CNCF
Slack workspace. OTel maintainers, contributors, and other end users hang out
there and can answer your questions.

Any channel staring with *#otel-* is good, but some of the channels you might want to keep an eye on are:

- #opentelemetry
- #otel-semantic-conventions
- #otel-community-demo
- #otel-vendor

Not sure where to ask? Post in #otel-end-user, and we will help you find the
channel for you.

## Respond to a survey

Sometimes it is us who want to ask questions. Different Special Interest Groups
in OpenTelemetry run surveys to better understand our users‚Äô needs and make
better informed decisions when building OTel. Here are a few examples:

- [Contributor Experience Survey](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/contribex-survey-results/)
- [Developer Experience Survey](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/devex-survey/)
- [Docs Usability Survey](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2024/otel-docs-survey/)

## Join a podcast

The ultimate way to share your experience in our toolbox is joining our
podcasts. We regularly do two types of them:

- OTel Me
  - A discussion between our host and end users about their experience with
    OpenTeletry.
  - [OTel Me Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdywIl9xKEo5_u7zlwY38dW43)
- OTel in practice
  - A presentation of interesting OTel concepts by contributors.
  - [OTel in Practice Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdyxKgdGE4ThYLkNRCuLLYy9x)
  <!--‚û°Ô∏è TODO: Turn links into embeds-->

We do the podcasts live and recordings are posted on OpenTelemetry YouTube
channel. If you want to talk about your experience with OpenTelemetry, please,
let us know in *#otel-sig-end-user* channel in the CNCF Slack workspace or open an issue in https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-end-user repo.
