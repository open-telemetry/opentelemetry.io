  Different ways how end users can provide feedback to the OpenTelemetry
  project.

You don‚Äôt have to become a contributor to have influence in OpenTelemetry. Just
by showing up with your perspective as an end user, you‚Äôre helping shape the
future of the project. The OTel maintainers and contributors are deeply invested
in building a project that meets real-world needs, and they need your input,
regardless if you work in a giant corp, tiny startup, or you are just hacking in
your garage.

Different people prefer different ways to share their feedback. Some like to
have a conversation, others prefer responding to a survey, for others giving a
üëç is enough. We have them all covered.

## Give thumbs up

If you encounter a bug, unexpected behavior, or a limitation, reporting it is
one of the most effective ways to help improve the project.

First, review the OpenTelemetry issues to see if anyone already reported it
before you. Giving a thumbs up or sharing more context in a comment is exactly
what we‚Äôre looking for. Are you the first person who bumped into this problem?
File an issue in our repository.

## Chat on Slack

Questions, clarifications, or observations do not fit well into issues but are
just as important. You can voice them in OpenTelemetry related channels in CNCF
Slack workspace. OTel maintainers, contributors, and other end users hang out
there and can answer your questions.

Some of the channels you might want to keep an eye on are:

- #opentelemetry
- #otel-collector
- #otel-semantic-conventions
- #otel-community-demo

Not sure where to ask? Post in #otel-end-user, and we will help you find the
channel for you.

## Respond to a survey

Sometimes it is us who want to ask questions. Different Special Interest Groups
in OpenTelemetry run surveys to better understand our users‚Äô needs and make
better informed decisions when building OTel. We have already run XXX surveys
and sourced feedback from XXX respondents.

Example surveys:

<!--‚û°Ô∏è TODO: Add links/embeds to a blogposts for 3-5 surveys-->

Currently, we are running a
<!--Name of the survey (this whole line could be updated regularly based on the task in Survey template)-->
survey, and we want to hear from you as well.

## Join a podcasts

The ultimate way to share your experience in our toolbox is joining our
podcasts. We regularly do 2 types of them:

- OTel-Me
  - A discussion between our host and end users about their experience with
    OpenTeletry.
  - <!--Embedded/link to the most recent session -->
- OTel in practice
  - A presentation of interesting OTel concepts by contributors.
  - <!--Embedded/link to the most recent session -->

We do the podcasts live and recordings are posted on OpenTelemetry YouTube
channel. If you want to talk about your experience with OpenTelemetry, please,
let us know.

Do you have any questions or tips how to improve end user feedback collection
for OpenTelemetry? Let us know in #otel-sig-end-user in CNCF Slack.

<!--Looking to connect with other OpenTelemetry end users in a vendor-agnostic
space, or to learn more about OpenTelemetry? Perhaps you have some feedback
about your implementation or adoption that you'd like to share with project
contributors, or you want to help prioritize project issues. You've come to the
right place!

- To provide feedback and help prioritize work:
  - [Vote and comment on GitHub issues](issue-participation/), it only takes one
    click!
  - Participate in a [direct interview/feedback session](interviews-feedback/)
  - Take our [most recent survey](feedback-survey/)
- To learn about OpenTelemetry, check out:
  - [OTel in practice](otel-in-practice/)
  - Curated content on the
    [OpenTelemetry YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@otel-official)
- To connect with other end users and learn about upcoming events, join the
  [Slack channel](slack-channel/).

These forums aim to bring together operations and development engineers from
different organizations to discuss challenges and solutions to achieving
ubiquitous observability. We encourage you to share your successes and failures,
discover best practices, and meet others who are also on a journey to implement
observability powered by OpenTelemetry.

### Topics

This group is what its members make it -- whatever is of interest to the group
is fair game!

But here are some of the kinds of things we expect will be on the table:

- Refactoring with telemetry
- What is company X doing with OpenTelemetry?
- Correlating multiple observability signals
- Maintaining and scaling OpenTelemetry deployments
- Writing custom instrumentation

### Questions

**Is this group only for OpenTelemetry end users?**

Everybody is welcome to join and discuss their journey to observability. This
group is hosted by the OpenTelemetry Community End-User SIG, so we expect most
participants will be from organizations that are evaluating or using
OpenTelemetry.

**I have questions about this, who can I reach out to?**

You can find members of the
[OpenTelemetry End User SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-end-user) in
[#otel-sig-end-user](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ).-->
