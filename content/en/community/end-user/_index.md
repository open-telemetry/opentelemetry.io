description: Vendor-agnostic resources for OpenTelemetry users
---

The
[OpenTelemetry End User SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/tree/main/working-groups/end-user)
has heard feedback from users who desire a vendor-agnostic space to discuss
OpenTelemetry adoption and implementation, so we provide the following ways for
you to connect with other users of the project, learn about OTel, and provide
feedback about your OTel usage:

- [Slack channel](slack-channel/)
- [Talks about OTel in practice](otel-in-practice/)
- [Direct interview/feedback sessions](interviews-feedback/)
- Panel discussions and surveys
- Curated content on the
  [OpenTelemetry YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@otel-official)

These forums aim to bring together operations and development engineers from
different organizations to discuss challenges and solutions to achieving
ubiquitous observability. Share successes and failures, discover best practices,
and meet others who are also on a journey to implement observability powered by
OpenTelemetry.

### Topics

This group is what its members make it -- whatever is of interest to the group
is fair game!

But here are some of the kinds of things we expect will be on the table:

- Refactoring with telemetry
- What is company X doing with OpenTelemetry?
- Correlating multiple observability signals
- Maintaining and scaling OpenTelemetry deployments
- Writing custom instrumentation

### Questions

**Is this group only for OpenTelemetry end users?**

No! Anyone is welcome to join and discuss their journey to observability. This
group is hosted by the OpenTelemetry Community End-User SIG, so we expect most
participants will be from organizations that are evaluating or using
OpenTelemetry.

**I have questions about this, who can I reach out to?**

You can find members of the End User SIG in
