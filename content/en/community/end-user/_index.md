You don‚Äôt have to become a contributor to have influence in OpenTelemetry. Just
by showing up with your perspective as an end user, you‚Äôre helping shape the
future of the project. The OTel maintainers and contributors are deeply invested
in building a project that meets real-world needs, and they need your input,
regardless if you work in a giant corp, tiny startup, or you are just hacking in
your garage.

Different people prefer different ways to share their feedback and learn from
each other. Some like to have a conversation, others prefer responding to a
survey, and for others, giving a üëç is enough. We have you covered.

## Report an issue or give a thumbs up

If you encounter a bug, unexpected behavior, or a limitation, reporting it is
one of the most effective ways to help improve the project.

First, review the OpenTelemetry issues to see if anyone already reported it
before you. Giving a thumbs up or sharing more context in a comment is exactly
what we‚Äôre looking for. Are you the first person who bumped into this problem?
File an issue in one of our repositories.

## Chat on Slack {#slack}

Questions, clarifications, or observations don't always fit well into issues but
are just as important. You can voice them in OpenTelemetry-related channels in
CNCF Slack workspace. OTel maintainers, contributors, and other end users hang
out there and can answer your questions.

Any channel starting with _#otel-_ is good, but some of the channels you might
want to keep an eye on are:

- #opentelemetry
- #otel-semantic-conventions
- #otel-community-demo
- #otel-vendor

Not sure where to ask? Post to
[#otel-sig-end-user](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ), and
we will help you find the right channel.

## Respond to a survey {#survey}

Sometimes it's us who want to ask the questions! Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
in OpenTelemetry run surveys to better understand our users‚Äô needs and make
better-informed decisions when building OTel. Here are a few examples of surveys
we've run previously:

- [Contributor Experience Survey](/blog/2025/contribex-survey-results/)
- [Developer Experience Survey](/blog/2025/devex-survey/)
- [Docs Usability Survey](/blog/2024/otel-docs-survey/)
<!--‚û°Ô∏è TODO: Turn links into embeds-->

## Join a podcast {#podcast}

The ultimate way to share your experience in our toolbox is joining our
podcasts. We regularly do two types of them:

- [OTel Me](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdywIl9xKEo5_u7zlwY38dW43):
  A discussion between our host and end users about their OpenTelemetry adoption
  and implementation.
- [OTel in Practice](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdyxKgdGE4ThYLkNRCuLLYy9x):
  An interactive enablement session on different aspects of OpenTelemetry by
  contributors and end users.
  <!--‚û°Ô∏è TODO: Turn links into embeds-->

We do the podcasts live and recordings are posted on the OpenTelemetry YouTube
channel. If you want to talk about your experience with OpenTelemetry,
[let us know](#contact).
