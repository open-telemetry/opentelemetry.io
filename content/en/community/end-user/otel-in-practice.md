We’re aiming to:

- Address practical problems that commonly stop development teams from
  succeeding with OpenTelemetry
- Build stronger connections with developers focused on specific languages
- Improve the experience of implementing OpenTelemetry in production

Each OpenTelemetry in Practice session will include a half hour of lightning
talks and a half hour of open conversation about the topic. We are looking for
people to join the OpenTelemetry in Practice team and people to give talks at
future events. So if you’re interested in shaping these conversations, reach out
in the
[#otel-user-research channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ)
of the [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io).

Join the
[OpenTelemetry in Practice Meetup Group](https://meetup.com/opentelemetry-in-practice-meetup-group)
to get invited to our next talk!
