Weâ€™re aiming to:

- Address practical problems that commonly stop development teams from
  succeeding with OpenTelemetry
- Build stronger connections with developers focused on specific languages
- Improve the experience of implementing OpenTelemetry in production

Each OTel in Practice session typically includes one or more talks by end users
or project contributors, with space for discussion. We welcome speakers from all
backgrounds! If you're interested in sharing what you've learned in a 15-minute
lightning talk or a longer 30-minute session, reach out in the
[#otel-sig-end-user channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ)
on the [CNCF's Slack](https://slack.cncf.io).
