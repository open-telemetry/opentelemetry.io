We’re aiming to:

- Address practical problems that commonly stop development teams from
  succeeding with OpenTelemetry
- Build stronger connections with developers focused on specific languages
- Improve the experience of implementing OpenTelemetry in production

Each OTel in Practice session typically includes one or more talks by end 
users or project contributors, with space for discussion. We welcome speakers
from all backgrounds! If you're interested in sharing what you've learned in a
15-minute lightning talk or a longer 30-minute session, reach out
in the
[#otel-sig-end-user channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ)
on the [CNCF's Slack](https://slack.cncf.io).

You can view [past sessions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdyxKgdGE4ThYLkNRCuLLYy9x) on the OpenTelemetry YouTube channel.
