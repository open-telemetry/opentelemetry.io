Interested in learning how other end users are implementing OpenTelemetry in
their organizations? Come talk shop with other OpenTelemetry end users! This is
a vendor-neutral space to discuss best practices, ask questions, and meet other
observability-minded folks.

Feedback that is shared and collected in these sessions will be routed back to
the relevant project maintainers to help drive prioritization of improvements
and changes to the project.

## About

- Sessions are available for all regions!
- Search the blog for "End-User Discussions" to find summaries of past
  discussions.
- A project maintainer and/or a Governance Committee member will be in
  attendance at each session to provide additional context, insight, and plans
  to user questions and feedback.
- Sessions are recorded.
