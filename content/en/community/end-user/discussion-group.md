 Monthly OpenTelemetry usage discussions -- all are welcome!

Interested in learning how other end users are implementing OpenTelemetry
in their organizations? Come talk shop with other OpenTelemetry end users!
This is a vendor-neutral space to discuss best practices, ask questions,
and meet other observability-minded folks. 

Feedback that is shared and collected in these sessions will be routed back 
to the relevant project maintainers to help drive prioritization of  
improvements and changes to the project.

**New for 2023!**
* APAC (Asia Pacific) sessions begin, come join the first session on January 18!
* A project maintainer and/or a Governance Committee member will be in
attendance at each session to provide additional context, insight, and plans to 
user questions and feedback.
* The Chatham House Rule will no longer be applied, and **sessions will be recorded**. 
This will help make the feedback more discoverable by the community.

Past topics/questions have included:

* Best practices on monitoring collectors in production
* Using OTel in CI/CD pipelines
* Whatâ€™s holding you back from adopting more OpenTelemetry?
* Auto vs manual instrumentation use cases
* How to secure a publicly exposed OTel Collector?

We use a [Lean Coffee](https://leancoffee.org/) format where discussion topics
are generated and democratically selected by the group at the start of the
meeting. Topics are rigorously time-boxed by a facilitator.
