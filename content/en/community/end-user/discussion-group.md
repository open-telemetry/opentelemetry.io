**As of April 2024, discussion group sessions are discontinued in favor of
end-user panels with a more targeted focus.**

If you would like to participate or help organize a future end-user panel, you
can find members of the
[OpenTelemetry End User SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-end-user) in
[#otel-sig-end-user](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ).
