Interested in learning how other end users are implementing OpenTelemetry in
their organizations? Come talk shop with other OpenTelemetry end users! This is
a vendor-neutral space to discuss best practices, ask questions, and meet other
observability-minded folks.

Feedback that is shared and collected in these sessions will be routed back to
the relevant project maintainers to help drive prioritization of improvements
and changes to the project.

**New for 2023!**

- Sessions are now available for all regions!
- You can now find summaries of past discussions every month! Search the blog
  for "End-User Discussions".
- A project maintainer and/or a Governance Committee member will be in
  attendance at each session to provide additional context, insight, and plans
  to user questions and feedback.
- The Chatham House Rule will no longer be applied, and **sessions will be
  recorded**. This will help make the feedback more discoverable by the
  community.

Past topics/questions have included:

- Best practices on monitoring collectors in production
- Using OTel in CI/CD pipelines
- Whatâ€™s holding you back from adopting more OpenTelemetry?
- Auto vs manual instrumentation use cases

We use a [Lean Coffee](https://leancoffee.org) format where discussion topics
are generated and democratically selected by the group at the start of the
meeting. Topics are rigorously time-boxed by a facilitator.
