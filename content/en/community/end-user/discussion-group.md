Interested in learning how other end users are implementing OpenTelemetry
in their organizations? Come talk shop with other OpenTelemetry end users!
This is a vendor-neutral space to discuss best practices, ask questions,
and meet other observability-minded folks.

Here are upcoming sessions based on regions, or you can view them on the
[OpenTelemetry calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar):

* **AMER**
  * November 17 9AM PST
  * December 15 9AM PST
* **EMEA**
  * November 15 11AM CET
  * December 20 11AM CET
* **APAC**
  * TBD! If you are interested in facilitating these meetings for this region,
    please reach out to Reese Lee or Rynn Mancuso in CNCF Slack.

Past topics/questions have included:

* Best practices on monitoring collectors in production
* Using OTel in CI/CD pipelines
* Whatâ€™s holding you back from adopting more OpenTelemetry?
* Auto vs manual instrumentation use cases
* How to secure a publicly exposed OTel Collector?

We use a [Lean Coffee](https://leancoffee.org/) format where discussion topics
are generated and democratically selected by the group at the start of the
meeting. Topics are rigorously time-boxed by a facilitator.

[Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)
applies. Meetings will not be recorded.
