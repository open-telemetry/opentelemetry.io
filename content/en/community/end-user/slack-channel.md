Join our Slack channel to connect with other OpenTelemetry end users!

First, [request an invitation](https://slack.cncf.io/) to CNCF's Slack instance.
Next, join
[`#otel-sig-end-user`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ), and
introduce yourself if you'd like.

We encourage questions and discussions about adoption and implementation. You
can also hear about upcoming events and get a chance to contribute to the
project by participating in surveys and user feedback sessions. Note the
following:

- Troubleshooting or tactical SDK specific questions are still best directed to
  individual SIG channels or the
  [`#opentelemetry`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q) channel.
- Vendor specific questions are still best directed to vendor channels, or if it
  doesnâ€™t exist,
  [`#otel-vendor`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C031SAMGV2A)
