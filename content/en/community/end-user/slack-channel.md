  Join a Slack channel to discuss OpenTelemetry with other end users.

Previously, we had a private channel to provide a space for end users to discuss
adoption and implementation issues while allowing them to maintain a layer of
privacy and to meet compliance concerns. Now that the project and community have
grown, and with the transition of the End User WG to End User SIG, we believe
that this private channel is no longer needed.

As of April 2024, we will begin shifting all of our communications to the
[#otel-sig-end-user](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ)
channel (previously named the #otel-user-research channel), and will be
archiving the private channel by April 30, 2024.

We encourage you to join us over at #otel-sig-end-user to learn about our new
charter, what you can expect from us as an end user, and more. Note the
following:

- Troubleshooting or tactical SDK specific questions are still best directed to
  individual SIG channels or the
  [#opentelemetry](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q) channel.
- Vendor specific questions are still best directed to vendor channels, or if it
  doesn’t exist,
  [#otel-vendor](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C031SAMGV2A)
