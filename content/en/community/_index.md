## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in order to
improve our workflow and more easily manage a community project. [Read
more](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#special-interest-groups) from
our [community repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community).

## Open Source Collaboration

OpenTelemetry collaborates and integrates with other open source projects
