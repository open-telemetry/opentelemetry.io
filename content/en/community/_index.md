## End User Resources

Do you have feedback that you want to share with maintainers as an OpenTelemetry
user? Are you interested in sharing challenges and success stories with other

[End User Resources](/community/end-user/) to learn more!

## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into
[Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#special-interest-groups)
in order to improve our workflow and more easily manage a community project.

[community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community).
