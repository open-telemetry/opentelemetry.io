Back in October 2022, I wrote about
[becoming OpenTelemetry's first community manager](/blog/2022/announcing-community-manager/).
At the time, the project had just over 5000 contributors. Since then, those
numbers have grown considerably -- almost 20,000 people have contributed to the
project! As our community grows, the role and scope of community management must
grow with it.

Community management matters a lot in open source, and while I'm proud of what
we've accomplished together over the past few years, I've reached a point where
I can no longer dedicate the time and focus this work demands. The role deserves
someone who can give it their full attention.

With that said, I'm happy to announce that
[Adriana Villela](https://github.com/avillela) and
[Reese Lee](https://github.com/reese-lee) are stepping into the community
manager role for OpenTelemetry. They'll be joined by
[Julia Furst Morgado](https://github.com/juliafmorgado), who is coming on board
as an associate community manager.

Adriana and Reese are already putting real effort into scoping and shaping what
community management should look like going forward. They'll be working across
existing user and community SIGs in both OpenTelemetry and the broader CNCF,
which is something I always wanted this role to do more of.

I've been part of this project since the OpenTracing days, and the thing that
keeps me coming back is the people. Contributors, end-users, maintainers -- they
make this thing go. I'm glad Adriana, Reese, and Julia are the ones picking this
up, and I'm excited to see how the role evolves under their stewardship.
