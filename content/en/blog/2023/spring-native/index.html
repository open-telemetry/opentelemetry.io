{{< blog/integration-badge >}} You have just built a [Spring Boot native image
application)(https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html).
But what about observability? You can enable OpenTelemetry instrumentation for
your Spring Boot native image application with the _OpenTelemetry starter_. Just
follow the instructions provided
[here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/spring-boot/#configuration).
You can also play with [this Spring Boot native image
application](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-examples/tree/main/spring-native#opentelemetry-spring-native-example)
and look at the HTTP requests, logs, and SQL requests telemetry data.
