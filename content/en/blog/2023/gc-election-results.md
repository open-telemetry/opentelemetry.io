The OpenTelemetry project is proud to announce the winners of the 2023
OpenTelemetry Governance Committee (GC) election! Before we get into the
results, I'd like to share some statistics about the election!

This year, 616 project members were eligible to vote. Of those, 206 cast
ballots, for a participation rate of about 33%! For comparison, the 2022
election saw 219 ballots cast with 513 eligible voters. Overall ballots cast
was similar year-over-year, but the number of eligible voters increased
significantly indicating that the project continues to grow.

With that out of the way, please join me in congratulating
[Winner 1](https://github.com/handle),
[Winner 2](https://github.com/handle),
[Winner 3](https://github.com/handle),
[Winner 4](https://github.com/handle), and
[Winner 5](https://github.com/handle)!
All will serve a two-year term.

We'd like to thank everyone who participated -- candidates, voters, and the
election organizers -- for their efforts. You can find the
[full results of the election here](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/1ee70ee4-11ce-11ee-aaf8-0a8c9aac83f9/view).
