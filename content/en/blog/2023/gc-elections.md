The OpenTelemetry project is excited to announce the 2023 OpenTelemetry
Governance Committee (GC) election. Nominations are due by end-of-day on 13
October 2023. The list of eligible candidates will be shared on 16 October 2023.
Voting will take place between 23 October 2023 and 25 October 2023, and the
final election results will be announced 27 October 2023.

## Vote!

If you are a
[member of standing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/governance-charter.md#members-of-standing)
in the OpenTelemetry community, we invite you to participate in this election to
ensure that the community is well-represented in the Governance Committee. In
this election four people must be elected, each with two-year terms.

If you have made contributions to our ecosystem not measured by the automatic
process, you can request
[an exception](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/governance-charter.md#members-of-standing)
to participate in the election before 23:59 UTC on 20 October 2023. The voter
roll with all members of standing and approved exceptions will be published by 6
October 2023 and continuously updated until the exception deadline.

Voting will be open between 00:00 UTC on 23 October 2023 00:00 UTC and 25
October 2023 23:59 UTC on
[Helios Voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/1ee70ee4-11ce-11ee-aaf8-0a8c9aac83f9/view);
voters will need to sign in with their GitHub account.
