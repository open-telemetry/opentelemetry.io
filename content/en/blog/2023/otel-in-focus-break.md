As we approach the end of an eventful year, we're announcing that "OpenTelemetry
in Focus", our platform for sharing updates about the OpenTelemetry project, is
taking an end-of-year break after ten successful editions in 2023.

Over the past year, OpenTelemetry in Focus has been a key resource for news and
insights about the OpenTelemetry project.
[Austin Parker](https://github.com/austinlparker) aimed to give a clear picture
of OTel's progress, the issues that got solved, and what is planned for the
future.

In those ten editions, each issue has highlighted the ongoing work, creativity,
and dedication that drive the OpenTelemetry project.

While OpenTelemetry in Focus is on a break, we will be working on a new and
improved format for it. Stay tuned!
