The OpenTelemetry PHP SIG is very excited to announce the release of [v1.0.0beta1](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/releases/tag/1.0.0beta1) of OpenTelemetry PHP.  This is the culmination of over 3 years of work done by the OpenTelemetry PHP team.  


We are actively soliciting feedback from the development community for this library. Please check out the repo, instrument your PHP app with the product, and open an [issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/issues/new/choose) if youâ€™d like to see a bug squashed or a new feature added.

There are many ways you can get started with our project:
* There are [examples](/docs/instrumentation/php/examples/) in the repo to get you started.
* The [getting started guide](/docs/instrumentation/php/getting-started/) can help you to instrument a sample php file.
* The [quote service](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/docs/services/quoteservice.md), is a demo application built in PHP to showcase the library.

Feel free to reach out to us in the CNCF [#otel-php](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01NFPCV44V) slack channel, or come to our SIG meeting, which you can find on the [otel public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com).
