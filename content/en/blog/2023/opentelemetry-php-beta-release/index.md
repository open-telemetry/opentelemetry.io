OpenTelemetry PHP Beta Release Blog Post

The OpenTelemetry PHP SIG is very excited to announce the release of [v1.0.0beta1](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/releases/tag/1.0.0beta1) of OpenTelemetry PHP.  This is the culmination of over 3 years of work done by the OpenTelemetry PHP team.  

We are actively soliciting feedback from the development community for this library.  Please check out the repo, instrument your PHP app with the product, and open an issue if youâ€™d like to see a bug squashed or a new feature added.

We have lots of [examples](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/tree/main/examples) in the repo to get you started, or you can check out the [quote service](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/docs/services/quoteservice.md), a demo application built in PHP to showcase the library.

Questions?  Feel free to reach out to us in the CNCF [#otel-php](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01NFPCV44V) slack channel, or come to our SIG meeting (which you can find on the [otel public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com))
