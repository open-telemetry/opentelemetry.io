The OpenTelemetry project maintainers, members of the governance committee, and
technical committee are thrilled to be at [KubeCon NA][] in Chicago from
November 6 - 9, 2023.

Read on to learn about all the things related OpenTelemetry during KubeCon.

## OpenTelemetry Contribfest

We are happy to announce, that for the first time, you can join the
OpenTelemetry maintainers in making OpenTelemetry better for everyone during the
[OpenTelemetry Contribfest](https://sched.co/1R2rQ), on Wednesday November 8,
2023 from 2:30pm - 3:55pm. There will be several opportunities to contribute:

- Join the Collector maintainers and help fix bugs, add new features, and add
  new transformation functions.
- Help the OTel JS maintainers update the instrumentation libraries and ensure
  they are outputting [semantic convention-compliant](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) telemetry data.
