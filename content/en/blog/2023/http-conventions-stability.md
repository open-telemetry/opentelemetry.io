The OpenTelemetry community is beginning the final push to declare HTTP
[tracing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md)
and
[metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/semantic_conventions/http-metrics.md)
semantic conventions stable!

Following the recently proposed
[Semantic Convention Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghvajKaipiNZso3fDtyNxU7x1zx0_Eyd02OGpMGEpLE),
the HTTP semantic convention stability working group will meet three times a
week for the next six weeks (starting January 30) to work through the remaining
[list of issues](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/41/views/1).
This group will submit spec PRs for any changes that need to be made prior to
declaring the HTTP semantic conventions stable.

Once this is done, the community will have four weeks to review and provide
feedback on the final set of PRs submitted by the working group.

And finally, the working group and spec approvers will have two weeks to clean
up and merge the final spec PRs, and mark the HTTP semantic conventions as
stable.

If you are interested in participating in the working group, please join the
meetings starting Monday, January 30 at 3pm Pacific Time, and continuing for six
weeks on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays:

- Mon 3-3:30pm Pacific Time
- Wed 3-3:30pm Pacific Time
- Fri 9:30-10am Pacific Time

[OpenTelemetry calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar)
