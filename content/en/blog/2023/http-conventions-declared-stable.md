Early this year, we launched an effort to stabilize HTTP semantic conventions.
Today, we proudly announce that the HTTP semantic conventions are the _first_
OpenTelemetry semantic conventions to be declared
**[stable](/docs/specs/otel/document-status/)**! This inaugural stable
[v1.23.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/releases/tag/v1.23.0)
release marks a substantial advancement from earlier versions, featuring:

- Enhancements resulting from
  [convergence with the Elastic Common Schema](/blog/2023/ecs-otel-semconv-convergence/),
  such as:
  - The `url.*` namespace, which can be reused in the future by non-HTTP
    semantic conventions
  - Replacing the `net.peer.*` and `net.host.*` namespaces with `client.*` and
    `server.*`, which
    - Works better for logs, where there's no span kind to indicate which side
      is peer and which side is host
    - Simplifies correlation across client and server telemetry (e.g. since you
      can join directly on `server.address` instead of joining where
      `net.peer.addr` == `net.host.addr`)
    - Provides a clean separation from the `network.*` namespace which is now
      only for low-level network attributes
  - More consistency around using the `http.request.*` and `http.response.*`
    namespaces
- Improved consistency with Prometheus through standardization on seconds for
  metric units.
- Streamlined attribute capture by omitting less useful attributes, reducing
  telemetry capture, processing, and storage costs.
- Clarified the definition of default values, eliminating ambiguities when
  attributes are absent.
- HTTP metrics are no longer vulnerable to cardinality explosion
  - `http.request.method` is limited to a (configurable) set of known methods
  - `server.address` and `server.port`, which are influenced by the `Host`
    header, are now Opt-In on HTTP metrics

## Migration plan

Due to the significant number of modifications and the extensive user base
affected by them, we require existing HTTP instrumentations published by
OpenTelemetry to implement a migration plan that will assist users in
transitioning to stable HTTP semantic conventions. We intend to use a similar
strategy when stabilizing other semantic conventions.

Specifically, when existing HTTP instrumentations published by OpenTelemetry are
updated to the stable HTTP semantic conventions, they:

- Need to introduce an environment variable `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` in
  their existing major version, which accepts:
  - `http` - emit the stable HTTP and networking conventions, and stop emitting
    the old HTTP and networking conventions that the instrumentation emitted
    previously.
  - `http/dup` - emit both the old and the stable HTTP and networking
    conventions, allowing for a phased rollout of the stable semantic
    conventions.
  - The default behavior (in the absence of one of these values) is to continue
    emitting whatever version of the old HTTP and networking conventions the
    instrumentation was emitting previously.
- Need to maintain (security patching at a minimum) their existing major version
  for at least six months after it starts emitting both sets of conventions.
- May drop the environment variable in their next major version and emit only
  the stable HTTP and networking conventions.

## Summary of changes

In this section, we summarize the changes made to the HTTP semantic conventions
from
[v1.20.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.20.0/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md)
to
[v1.23.0 (stable)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/v1.23.0/docs/http/).

### Migrating from `<= v1.17.0`

#### HTTP server span name

- When `http.route` is available:<br> `{http.route}` &rarr;
  `{summary} {http.route}`
- When `http.route` is not available:<br> `HTTP {http.method}` &rarr;
  `{summary}`

Where `{summary}` is `{http.method}`, unless `{http.method}` is `_OTHER`, in
which case `{summary}` is `HTTP`.

#### HTTP client span name
