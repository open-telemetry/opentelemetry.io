It's almost time for the next Outreachy cohort and I
([Juraci Paixão Kröhling](https://twitter.com/jpkrohling)) want to get YOU
involved, even if you are not a maintainer.

1. Perhaps you are NOT a maintainer, but there's a feature you dream on having
   implemented? Let me know! I'm looking for project ideas for Outreachy interns
   to work on. I'll try to find a mentor for your idea. Given this is all open
   source, you'll have a chance to follow the development closely.
2. Are you a maintainer and there's something you want to get done for your
   project? Even if you prefer not to be a mentor this time, I'd appreciate to
   receive project ideas from you. I'll try to find a mentor to work on it.
3. I hear you want to be a mentor? That's awesome! Outreachy is a great
   opportunity to improve your mentoring skills and to get someone to work on
   that feature you always wanted to get done but never really got around to
   actually do it. Typically, the outcome of the internship is great in many
   levels, being an interesting topic for conferences such as KubeCon.

What's a great idea, you ask? Small to medium-sized self-contained tasks,
suitable for new contributors. Your intern will likely be a person who's new to
our area (observability) and might not be an experienced programmer yet. That
said, they will have around 3 months to complete the task, which is typically
more than enough! In the past, people have been working on
[adding auto-instrumentation support for Python threading module](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2022-internship-round/communities/cncf-tracing/#add-auto-instrumentation-support-for-python-thread),
[creating component generators for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2022-internship-round/communities/cncf-tracing/#create-a-component-generator),
[benchmarking the client SDKs](https://www.outreachy.org/december-2018-march-2019-outreachy-internships/communities/cncf-tracing/#create-a-set-of-performance-tests),
[writing user-facing documentation](https://www.outreachy.org/2018-may-august/communities/cncf-tracing/#convert-and-revise-documentation-for-opentracing-s),
[experimenting with data visualization for distributed tracing](https://www.outreachy.org/december-2019-to-march-2020-internship-round/communities/cncf-tracing/#research-alternative-data-visualizations-for-traci)
and more.
