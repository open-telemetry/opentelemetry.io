As the collector community grows worldwide, having the ability to meet with each
other is a challenge. To help more APAC maintainers and contributors connect, we
have created two new meetings times:

- 1st Wednesday is EU-APAC friendly
- 3rd Wednesday is NA-APAC friendly

## Meeting times

|         | UTCâˆ’08:00 (PST) | UTC -05:00 (EST) | UTC +01:00 (CET) | UTC +08:00 (China) | UTC +10:00 (Sydney) |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| EU-APAC | 00:00           | 03:00            | 09:00            | 16:00              | 19:00               |
| NA-APAC | 15:00           | 18:00            | 00:00            | 07:00              | 10:00               |

To stay up to date with these times, subscribe to our

We look forward to seeing more of you, the collector community, at these new
meetings!
