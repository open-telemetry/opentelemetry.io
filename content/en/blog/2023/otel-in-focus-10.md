Welcome back to **OpenTelemetry in Focus** for October, 2023! It's been another
busy month as we prepare for KubeCon North America in Chicago. We've got a lot
to talk about once we're there, and we're excited to see you all in person!

me [via email](mailto:austin+otel@ap2.io), or on the

channel.

## Releases and Updates

Here are the latest updates from some of our core repositories.

<!-- markdownlint-disable heading-increment -->

##### [Specification and Semantic Conventions](/docs/specs/otel/)

Version 1.26.0 of the OpenTelemetry Specification has been released. This
release includes several small changes, along with a new section that explains
how OpenTelemetry handles upgrading and version management for components. For
full details, please visit the full changelog
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/compare/v1.25.0...v1.26.0)

Semantic Conventions v1.22.0 introduces critical changes to the JVM, HTTP,
System, and Messaging namespaces.

Major Breaking Changes, Highlights:

- All JVM metrics have been renamed from `process.runtime.jvm.*` to `jvm.*.`
- Added namespaces to JVM metric attributes.
- Renamed `http.client.duration` and `http.server.duration` metrics to
  `http.client.request.duration` and `http.server.request.duration`
  respectively.
- Renamed `jvm.classes.current_loaded` metrics to `jvm.classes.count.`
- Removed pluralization from JVM metric namespaces.
- Renamed several attribute metrics under `system.cpu.`, `system.memory.`,
  `system.paging.`, `system.disk.`, `system.filesystem.`, and `system.network.`
  metrics.

Significant changes for HTTP metrics include renaming
`http.server.request.size`metric to `http.server.request.body.size` and
`http.server.response.size` metric to `http.server.response.body.size`.
Important changes in messaging metrics entail renaming
`messaging.message.payload_size_bytes` to `messaging.message.body.size` and
removing `messaging.message.payload_compressed_size_bytes`. There have also been
crucial updates to telemetry metrics such as renaming `telemetry.auto.version`
resource attribute to `telemetry.distro.version`.

Numerous non-breaking changes have been introduced, including additions of new
attribute metrics, updates to naming conventions, and introducing new schemes
for certain metrics.

See
[this link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/releases/tag/v1.22.0)
for full release notes. Please be aware of these changes as you update your
OpenTelemetry SDKs.

##### [Collector](/docs/collector/)

October saw, as usual, two releases of the Collector. You can find the
[release notes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/tag/v0.88.0)
here.

These releases include two major feature enhancements, along with a handful of
deprecations. APIs have been introduced to control the mutability of `pdata`. In
addition, logging for all components will now default to sampled logging mode.
Certain structs and methods that were marked deprecated in earlier releases have
now been removed.

[collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.88.0)
also has seen multiple releases. Notable deprecations and breaking changes
include:

- `k8sclusterreceiver`: `opencensus.resourcetype` attribute removed.
- `splunkhecexporter` and `signalfxexporter`: `max_connections` configuration
  field removed, replaced by `max_idle_conns` or `max_idle_conns_per_host`.
- `dockerstatsreceiver`: `cpu.container.percent` deprecated in favor of
  `container.cpu.utilization`.
- `parquetexporter` has been removed.

In addition, many changes and enhancements have been made to a variety of
processors, receivers, and exporters.

The Operator has also been updated several times -- highlights include:

- Minimum required version of Kubernetes is now 1.23.
- Support for automatic instrumentation of NGINX pods.
- Improvements to the OpAMP bridge.
- Instrumentation libraries have been updated across the board.

See
[the release notes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/tag/v0.88.0)
for more details.

##### [Java](/docs/instrumentation/java/)

[Version 1.31.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/releases/tag/v1.31.0)
includes many small changes. Notably, there is a breaking change around the
semantic conventions package, as a new module has been published that aligns
with semantic convention versions.

[JavaInstrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/tag/v1.31.0)
includes new instrumentation for Apache Pekko, as well as many enhancements and
bug fixes.

#### [JavaScript](/docs/instrumentation/js/)

[Version 1.17.1](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/releases/tag/v1.17.1)
fixes several bugs in tracing and metrics. Experimental builds include several
bug fixes and enhancements to the logging exporter, the deprecation of direct
Jaeger export, and more.

#### [.NET](/docs/instrumentation/net/)

[Version 1.7.0-alpha](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/releases/tag/core-1.7.0-alpha.1)
includes many bug fixes and updates, including some breaking changes.
