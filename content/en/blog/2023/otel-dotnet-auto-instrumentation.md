The OpenTelemetry .NET SIG is happy to announce the
[first stable release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
of the OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation.

You can use the OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation to send traces,
metrics, and logs from .NET applications and services to observability backends
without having to modify their source code, including ASP.NET applications
deployed on IIS and Windows services running .NET applications.

The automatic instrumentation for .NET includes installer scripts and a NuGet
package that simplify the task of deploying and configuring the collection of
telemetry. The automatic instrumentation is fully compatible with manual
instrumentation in case you need to send custom spans or metrics.

To get started, [read the documentation](/docs/instrumentation/net/automatic) or
browse the
[examples](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/tree/main/examples)
for demonstrations of different instrumentation scenarios covered by the
OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation.
