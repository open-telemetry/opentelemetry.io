Welcome back to **OpenTelemetry in Focus** for August, 2023! It's been a busy
summer, so let's get into the updates without further ado.

## Releases and Updates

Here are the latest updates from some of our core repositories.

<!-- markdownlint-disable heading-increment -->

##### [Specification](/docs/specs/otel/)

[Version 1.24](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/releases/tag/v1.24.0)
includes metrics and logs.

##### [Collector](/docs/collector/)

[Version 0.84.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases/tag/v0.84.0)
has been released, along with 0.83.

Notable user-facing changes include:

- `loggingexporter` now supports exemplars logging when the verbosity level is
  set to detailed.
- `configgrpc` now allows the use of any registered gRPC load balancer name.
- Internal traces can now be exported via OTLP.
- `configgrpc` now supports the `:authority` pseudo-header in gRPC client.

In addition, there's a variety of bug fixes and changes in the Collector API for
exporters.

[collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.84.0)
includes many updates -- be sure to check the release notes.

There are several user-facing changes, including breaking changes:

- The `jaegerreceiver` has deprecated the remote_sampling config. It will now
  fail to start if the config is specified. In a future version, this feature
  will be removed and the receiver will always fail when the config is
  specified.
- The `googlecloudexporter` has removed the retry_on_failure config, as it
  caused issues when handling retries.
- The Datadog processor has been deprecated in favor of the Datadog connector.
- The Tanzu Observability (Wavefront) Exporter has been deprecated in favor of
  native OTLP ingestion.
- The redisreceiver now supports adding a username parameter for connecting to
  Redis.
- The `postgresqlreceiver` has added the postgresql.temp_files metric.
- The `receiver/azuremonitor` has added new attributes to metrics like name,
  type, and resource_group.
