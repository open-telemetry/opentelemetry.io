It's hard to believe as we prepare our 1.4.0 release but the
[OpenTelemetry demo](/docs/demo/) is turning 1 year old and it's been 6 months
since we declared general availability with our
[1.0.0 release](/blog/2022/announcing-opentelemetry-demo-release/).

### Project Milestones

The demo has achieved remarkable milestones in its first year, with more than
**70 contributors, 20 official vendor forks, 780 Github stars, and 180K Docker
pulls**. The project team has been hard at work adding new capabilities and
improving on existing ones with more than _460 merged PRs, 5 re-written services
in new languages, and 7 brand new components / services_.

Time flies when you're stabilizing semantic conventions. But what's actually
changed between our 1.0.0 and 1.4.0 releases? Quite a lot actually.

### The Highlights

- **2x build time improvements despite adding additional services**
- _Support added for arm64 architectures (M1 and M2 Macs)_
- **Async support using Kafka and the new Fraud Detection (Kotlin) / Accounting
  (Go) services**
- _Kubernetes manifest to enable Kubernetes deployment without using requiring
  Helm_
- **More out of the box dashboards like our
  [Collector Data Flow Dashboard](/docs/demo/collector-data-flow-dashboard/)**
- **A myriad of frontend bug fixes**
- _Our first
  [Connector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/connector/README.md)
  in the Collector to demonstrate how telemetry pipelines can be linked_
- **New OTel SDKs like the Java logging SDK and JavaScript / Go Metric SDK**
- _New manual metric instruments in the Ad, Currency, Product Catalog services_
- **PHP no-code change auto-instrumentation**
- _Browser and compute resource detectors that enrich our data with
  infrastructure information_
- **More [feature flag scenarios](/docs/demo/feature-flags/) like generating a
  failure for every 10th Ad shown**
- _General stability improvements to fix service restarts_
