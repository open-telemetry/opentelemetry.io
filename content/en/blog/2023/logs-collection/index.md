In the following, we will walk through how to do [logs
collection])/docs/concepts/signals/logs/) with OpenTelemetry (OTel). To keep
things simple, we will use Python as the demonstration programming language,
however note that at time of writing the logs support there is still early days
so things might need some updating.

We will show the evolution from using print statements for logging (_Baby Grogu_
level) to logging to a file along with the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/collector/) (_Expert Grogu_ level) to using the
OTel logs bridge API to directly ingest [OTLP](/docs/specs/otlp/) (_Yoda_ level)
into the Collector.

If you want to follow along, you need Docker installed and first off, go ahead
and `git clone https://github.com/mhausenblas/ref.otel.help.git` and change into
the `how-to/logs-collection/` directory.

## Baby Grogu level

We start our journey with Baby Grogu, an alias to protect the innocent ;) They
are a junior developer who is somewhat familiar with Python, however, doesn't
know or care about telemetry, more precisely, about logging. So, Baby Grogu one
day is asked to write a "Practice The Telemetry" piece of code including
catching bad input. What will the code look like and how will Baby Grogu deal
with communicating progress in the code execution and potential error cases to
the outside world?

To get started, first change into the [baby-grogu/][repo-baby-grogu] directory.

We're using Baby Grogu's Python code in `baby-grogu/main.py` as an example, with
the interesting part located in the `practice()` function:

```python
start_time = time.time()
try:
    how_long_int = int(how_long)
    print(f"Starting to practice The Telemetry for {how_long_int} second(s)")
    while time.time() - start_time < how_long_int:
        next_char = random.choice(string.punctuation)
        print(next_char, end="", flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.5)
    print("\nDone practicing")
except ValueError as ve:
    print(f"I need an integer value for the time to practice: {ve}")
    return False
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    return False
return True
```

The above Python code doesn't really do anything useful, just printing out
random punctuation for the specified time, which represents the "practicing".
However, do notice the different semantics of the `print()` function Baby Grogu
is using here.

For example, when they say `print(next_char, end="", flush=True)` they're
actually performing work, whereas when they write `print("\nDone practicing")`
that's an informational message that the work is completed. This would be a
great candidate for a log message!

The same is true for
`print(f"I need an integer value for the time to practice: {ve}")`, which really
is Baby Grogu communicating that an error has occurred.

To execute the code you can either directly run it with `python3 main.py 3` to
have Baby Grogu practice for 3 seconds, or you can use a containerized version
(Python 3.11 required).

For the containerized version, we're using the following `Dockerfile`:

```docker
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .
```

Above Dockerfile, we use in the context of the following Docker Compose file
`docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  baby-grogu:
    build: .
    command: python main.py 3
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
```

At this point you can enjoy Baby Grogu's efforts by running it with
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml` and you should see an output akin to
something shown in the following (note: edited to focus on the most important
bits):

```shell
baby-grogu-baby-grogu-1  | Starting to practice The Telemetry for 2 second(s)
baby-grogu-baby-grogu-1  | /)||
baby-grogu-baby-grogu-1  | Done practicing
baby-grogu-baby-grogu-1  | Practicing The Telemetry completed: True
```

OK, Baby Grogu did a good job, now it's time to rest. Go get up, drink a bit of
water, and when you come back with a fresh mind, let's up the game and use OTel!

## Expert Grogu level

Over time, Baby Grogu has learned about observability and telemetry
specifically. They have advanced to Expert Grogu level. How? Glad you asked, let
me show you.

First, change into the [expert-grogu/][repo-expert-grogu] directory.

In this scenario Expert Grogu is logging into a file (in JSON format), from
their Python app. Then, they are using the OpenTelemetry Collector to read that
very log file, parse the log records using the [filelog receiver][filelog] in
the OTel collector and finally output it to `stdout` using the [debug
exporter][debug]. Makes sense? Let's see it in action â€¦

Overall, we have the following setup:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    app["python main.py"] -->  logfile["exgru.log"]
    logfile["exgru.log"] -->  otelcol["OTel collector"]
    otelcol["OTel collector"] -->  stdout["stdout"]
```

Let's first have a look at what Expert Grogu is doing in terms of logging (in
`expert-grogu/main.py`, in the `practice()` function):

```python
start_time = time.time()
try:
    how_long_int = int(how_long)
    logger.info("Starting to practice The Telemetry for %i second(s)", how_long_int)
    while time.time() - start_time < how_long_int:
        next_char = random.choice(string.punctuation)
        print(next_char, end="", flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.5)
    logger.info("Done practicing")
except ValueError as ve:
    logger.error("I need an integer value for the time to practice: %s", ve)
    return False
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("An unexpected error occurred: %s", e)
    return False
return True
```

So, in above function we see Expert Grogu using `logger.xxx()` functions to
communicate status/progress as well as error conditions such as user providing
wrong input value for the time to practice (such as `python main.py ABC` rather
than `python main.py 5` since the former can't be parsed into an integer).

We are using the following `Dockerfile` (installing the one dependency we have,
`python-json-logger==2.0.7`):

```docker
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
```

With the following OTel Collector config (visualize via
[OTelBin][otelbin-expert-grogu]):

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [/usr/src/app/*.log]
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes.asctime
          layout: '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'
        severity:
          parse_from: attributes.levelname
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      exporters: [debug]
```

In the Docker Compose file that looks as follows, we bring all above together:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
    volumes:
      - ./otel-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
      - ./:/usr/src/app
    command: ['--config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml']
    ports:
      - '4317:4317'
  baby-grogu:
    build: .
    command: python main.py 10
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
```

Which you can run it with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml` and you should
see something like:

```log

## Yoda level

Now we're switching gears and look over Yoda's shoulders, a Telemetry Master.

First, change into the [yoda/][repo-yoda] directory.

In this scenario we see Yoda using the OTel logs bridge API in the Python app to
directly ingest logs, in [OpenTelemetry Protocol][otlp] (OTLP) format, into the
OTel Collector. This is both faster and more reliable than first logging to a
file and have the collector read it off of it!

Overall, we have the following setup Yoda is using:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    app["python main.py"]-- OTLP --> otelcol["OTel collector"]
    otelcol["OTel collector"] -->  stdout["stdout"]
```

With the following OTel collector config (visualize via
[OTelBin][otelbin-yoda]):

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [debug]
```

Now run Yoda's setup with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml` and you should
see something akin to below:

```shell

```

Fun, huh? You can play around with Yoda's source code to add more contextual
information and add processors to manipulate the log records as they pass the
collector, now.

May _The Telemetry_ be with you, young Padawan!

## What's next?

Now that you're familiar with _The Telemetry_ and its good practices, you could
extend Yoda's code to do the following:

1. Add more context. For example, try to use
   [OTel resource attributes](/docs/concepts/resources/) and the
   [semantic conventions](/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/) to make the
   context of the execution more explicit.
1. Enrich the logs in the OTel Collector or filter certain severity levels,
   using processors such as the
   [transform or attributes processors](/docs/collector/transforming-telemetry/).
1. Add [tracing](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) support by emitting spans,
   where it makes sense.
1. Add an Observability backend such as OpenSearch (along with [Data
   Prepper][dataprepper]) to the setup, allowing to ingest spans and logs in
   OTLP format.
1. Once you have traces and logs ingested in a backend, try to correlate these
   two telemetry signal types in the backend along with a frontend such as
   Grafana.
1. Use [Automatic Instrumentation](/docs/concepts/instrumentation/automatic/) to
   further enrich telemetry.

The community is currently working on the [Events API
Interface][otel-logs-events] which is a good place to continue your research and
maybe provide feedback?

## Kudos and References

Kudos go out to [Severin Neumann][svrnm] and [Houssam Chehab][hossko] who both
were very patient with me and pivotal concerning making Yoda level work, I owe
you!
