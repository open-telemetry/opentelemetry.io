Embracing OpenTelemetry's [vision], we are committed to enabling high-quality
telemetry throughout the entire software stack!

We're thrilled to see an expanding collection of
[libraries, services, and apps integrating](/ecosystem/integrations/)
OpenTelemetry, paving the way for inherent observability.

Future blog posts will feature a distinct badge, as showcased in this post, to
celebrate these integrations. This badge will also serve as a beacon, directing
readers back to this announcement. If you're keen to have your OpenTelemetry
integration spotlighted and featured in an upcoming blog, refer to
[How to add your integration](/ecosystem/integrations/#how-to-add).
