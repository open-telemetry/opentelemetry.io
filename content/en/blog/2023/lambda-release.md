The
[Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) SIG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/187XYoQcXQ9JxS_5v2wvZ0NEysaJ02xoOYNXj08pT0zc)
is incredibly excited to announce that the release of OpenTelemetry Lambda
layers, and associated [documentation](/docs/faas/) on how to monitor Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Lambdas.

## OTel FaaS repackaged

If you've been monitoring Lambdas using OTel for a while now, you may be
slightly confused by this announcement. You might think something like: OTel has
had a
[repo for Lambda layers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-lambda)
and they've been available on AWS for years.

You're totally correct. Rest assured, we're not reinventing the wheel. However,
there are some pre-existing problems that may impact users:

- The OTel Lambda layers were only released as part of the
  [AWS Distribution for OTel (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/), and the
  community had limited control over releases which meant a delay getting new
  features and fixes delivered.
- The layers available on AWS combined the Collector and auto-instrumentation
  capabilities into a single package, which contributed to performance
  degradations and limited user choice.
- There wasn't official OTel guidance on how to monitor Lambdas and no single
  source of truth for OTel users to reference.

The FaaS SIG has addressed the above-mentioned shortcomings:

- We have written new Github Actions to release the Lambda layers ourselves,
  thus empowering the community to make its own release decisions.
- Separated the Collector and instrumentation layers to give users options when
  instrumenting their Lambdas. We now offer a standalone Lambda layer for the
  Collector alongside auto-instrumentation layers for JavaScript, Java, and
  Python.
- Added official community Lambda documentation to the OTel website under the
  new [FaaS section](/docs/faas/).

## What next

Moving forward, the FaaS SIG plans to: enhance the documentation, add
auto-instrumentation for other Cloud vendors like Azure and GCP (tentative),
enhancing the existing Lambda assets, and improving OpenTelemetry performance
for Function specific scenarios.
