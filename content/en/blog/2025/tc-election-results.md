The OpenTelemetry
[Technical Committee](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/community-members.md#technical-committee)
is delighted to announce two new elected members! Please join us in
congratulating [David Ashpole](https://github.com/dashpole) and
[Josh MacDonald](https://github.com/jmacd)!

Both David and Josh are long-time OpenTelemetry contributors and specification
sponsors. David is bringing his experience with metrics, Prometheus, and
Kubernetes, where he is also a major contributor. Josh has been driving OTel
Arrow, trace sampling, and other OpenTelemetry projects. This is also Josh's
second stint as a Technical Committee member!

The Technical Committee and Governance Committee used these elections as an
opportunity to refine the election process. We have looked at the current gaps
we have at OpenTelemetry and identified a number of candidates that can help us
fill those gaps. The Technical Committee then voted and elected two new members.

We are very happy that David and Josh will be joining the Technical Committee to
help us advance the project.
