## OpenTelemetry is coming to FOSDEM!

When we put out our community survey, you requested more meetups and we have
heard you! We're happy to announce that we are bringing back
[OTel Unplugged](https://events.humanitix.com/otelunplugged-eu2026), the
OpenTelemetry unconference that we first ran in 2022.

## What is OTel Unplugged?

OTel Unplugged is an OpenTelemetry unconference and project roadmapping session.
An unconference is like a conference, only instead of a speaker track, we have a
series of breakout sessions where attendees get to pick the topics. If you are
an end user, this is a great opportunity to connect with maintainers and other
users to get your questions answered and give feedback to the project. If you
are a maintainer or contributor, the is your chance to connect with your users
face to face!

With everything fresh in our minds from the breakout sessions, we will end with
a project roadmapping session. This is an opportunity to give suggestions and
vote in order to communicate what your priorities are for this next year.

## When and where is it happening?

OTel Unplugged will be happening on Monday, February 2nd, the day after
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2026/). The event will be will be the lovely Sparks
meeting hall located in central Brussels.
