## OpenTelemetry is coming to FOSDEM!

When we put out our community survey, you requested more meetups and we have
heard you! We're happy to announce that we are bringing back [OTel Unplugged][],
the OpenTelemetry unconference that we
[first ran in 2022](../../2022/otel-unplugged-kubecon-na/).

## What is OTel Unplugged?

OTel Unplugged is an OpenTelemetry [unconference] and project roadmapping
session. An unconference is like a conference, only instead of a speaker track,
we have a series of breakout sessions where attendees get to pick the topics. If
you are an end user, this is a great opportunity to connect with maintainers and
other users to get your questions answered and give feedback to the project. If
you are a maintainer or contributor, the is your chance to connect with your
users face to face!

With everything fresh in our minds from the breakout sessions, we will end with
a project roadmapping session. This is an opportunity to give suggestions and
vote in order to communicate what your priorities are for this next year.

## When and where is it happening?

OTel Unplugged will be happening on Monday, February 2nd, the day after
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2026/). The event will be held in the lovely Sparks
meeting hall located in central Brussels.
