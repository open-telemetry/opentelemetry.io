## Announcing New OpenTelemetry Technical Committee Members

The OpenTelemetry Technical Committee is delighted to announce 2 new elected
members! Please join us in congratulating
[David Ashpole](https://github.com/dashpole) and
[Josh MacDonald](https://github.com/jmacd)!

Both David and Josh are long-time OpenTelemetry contributors and specification
sponsors ( and it is Josh's second stint as a Technical Committee member!).
David is bringing his experience with metrics and with Kubernetes (where he is
also a major contributor) and Prometheus, while Josh has been driving OTel
Arrow, trace sampling and other OpenTelemetry projects recently.

The Technical Committee and Governance Committee used these elections as an
opportunity to refine the election process. We have looked at the current gaps
we have at OpenTelemetry and identified a number of candidates that can help us
fill those gaps. The Technical Committee then voted and elected 2 new members.

We are very happy that David and Josh will be joining the Technical Committee to
help us advance the project further.
