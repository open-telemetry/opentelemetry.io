## Maintainer Summit

Held on November 9, one day prior to the co-located events and conference, the
Maintainer Summit is an exclusive opportunity for the people behind the project
to gather face-to-face. [Members][membership] of the OpenTelemetry organization
will come together to collaborate, learn, share ideas, solve problems, and
enrich their projects. Prepared talks, project meetings, and unconference
sessions run from 9:00 to 17:00. See the [full schedule][summit schedule] for
all the details. [Sign up][maintainer summit] today!

## Observability Day

[Observability Day] fosters collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing
with a focus on cloud native observability projects. This event will be held on
November 10, 2025 from 9:00 to 18:00. Look for your favorite talks about
Observability and OpenTelemetry in the [schedule][obs-day-sched].

## OpenTelemetry Observatory

Drop by and say _"Hi!"_ at OpenTelemetry Observatory presented by Splunk in the
Expo Hall. This will be a place for informal chats, meetups, and other
discussions led by OpenTelemetry community members and maintainers, such as:

- SIG Office Hours: Come meet the people behind the project, learn about their
  work, ask questions, share feedback, or find out how to contribute.
- Special Topic Discussions: Come learn about the hottest topics in the OTel
  community.

If you'd like to participate by leading a discussion, or if there is a
discussion topic you're interested in, please reach out to the [OpenTelemetry
End User SIG][end user] to let us know, and we will see what we can do.

For activity details, see the [OTel Observatory Schedule]. This schedule is a
work in progress and will be updated up until the day of the event. Check back
often for the latest!

## OpenTelemetry Community Awards

OpenTelemetry is a community-driven project, fueled by a group of awesome humans
who are actively revolutionizing the field of observability with their
contributions. Whether it‚Äôs through code, documentation, project management,
outreach, adoption, or simply helping others, we want to recognize these
contributions and the people behind them.

Nominations for this year's awards will open soon, and we'll announce the
winners during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America!

Come join us to listen, learn, and get involved in OpenTelemetry.

See you in Atlanta!
