The OpenTelemetry project invites you to join members of the OpenTelemetry
community at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Japan][] ([registration][]) and at the
co-located [Community Day][] in Tokyo spanning from June 14 to 17, 2025.

This post covers all currently scheduled activities related to OpenTelemetry
that are happening during KubeCon. Check back for updates before the start of
the conference!

## Community Day

Taking place on June 15, this **free** event offers a chance to engage with the
cloud native community before the main conference begins.

[Community Day][] will bring together attendees of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon
Japan and members of various local meetup communities, Special Interest Groups
(SIGs) and subgroups within Cloud Native Community Japan to foster
collaboration, learning, and contribution to the cloud native ecosystem. The
event is structured to offer multiple tracks with multiple themes, each
targeting a different aspect of cloud native development and community
involvement. Register today!
