We are delighted to announce the results of the
[2025 OpenTelemetry Governance Committee Election](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/elections/2025/governance-committee-election.md)!

The OpenTelemetry project continues to bring together an exceptionally vibrant
community, who are shaping the future of observability with their contributions.
This year, active contributors have shown their commitment again by
participating in our election process, and they've done it in great numbers.

702 contributors were eligible to vote this year, and 273 of them cast their
ballot. With a participation rate of 39%, it is in line with last year's
participation rate, where 299 ballots were cast with 701 eligible voters.

Five positions were up for election in this year's Governance Committee
selection process. Without further ado, please join us in congratulating
[Austin Parker](https://github.com/austinlparker),
[Juraci Paixão Kröhling](https://github.com/jpkrohling),
[Marylia Gutierrez](https://github.com/maryliag),
[Severin Neumann](https://github.com/svrnm), and
[Ted Young](https://github.com/tedsuo)! All will serve a two-year term.

We'd like to thank everyone who participated -- candidates, voters, and the
election organizers -- for their efforts. You can find the
[full results of the election here](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/f94a7c58-990b-11f0-a16d-5270fb641b4c/view).
