OpenTelemetry is a community-driven project, fueled by a group of awesome humans
who are actively revolutionizing the field of observability with their
contributions. Whether it's through code, documentation, project management,
outreach, adoption, or simply helping others answer technical questions on our
[CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/), we want to recognize these contributions
and the people behind them â€” because we're all human, and we all like that warm
fuzzy feeling of appreciation.

We are thrilled to announce the second annual **OpenTelemetry Community
Awards**! This is your chance to nominate individuals who have made a notable
impact to OpenTelemetry over the past year. _Everyone_ can nominate _anyone_ in
the community, be they a contributor, end-user, or community member.

[Submit nominations online](https://forms.gle/Y3UwmQrjVif4NQJs5) by **midnight
UTC on November 6th, 2025**[^1]. You can nominate up to five people per
submission.

Winners will be announced at
[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025](/blog/2025/kubecon-na/).

    Although we require sign-in to ensure only one form submission per person,
    nominations are completely anonymous.
