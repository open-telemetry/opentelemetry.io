You might have heard about OpenTelemetry, found it interesting and want to get
involved, but the path to contribution isn't immediately clear. You might start
messaging people asking to get assigned to issues, or just give a shout out
saying “I'm here to help, just let me know”, but you never hear back. So how can
you actually start contributing to OpenTelemetry?

Open source thrives on community, mutual support, and the collaborative
development of innovative technology. It also comes with challenges, especially
if you're new to this ecosystem.

## Open source contribution dynamics

In open source, you are the architect of your own contribution journey. No one
will assign tasks or dictate your every move. Instead, you need to be proactive,
identify areas where assistance is needed, and take the initiative to work on
them.

It's crucial to understand that open source contributions differ from a
traditional job where a manager or tech lead assigns tasks. In open source, the
decision of what you will work on rests with you.

## Identifying your contribution area

You might want to contribute for different reasons: developing a feature
essential for your organization; addressing a bug in a component you actively
use; acquiring new skills and expanding your knowledge base; becoming an active
member of a vibrant, collaborative community; expanding your professional
connections within the tech industry, etc.

Begin by exploring areas within OpenTelemetry that align with your existing
expertise or ignite your curiosity. OpenTelemetry is a vast project,
encompassing numerous components, diverse programming languages, and features
spanning various levels of complexity. Consider what resonates most with you.

This page lists all existing SIG with their respective slack channels and
meeting times: [SIGs][sigs]. You can also subscribe to the OpenTelemetry
calendar and check the meetings you're interested in: [Calendar][calendar].

While it might be tempting to pick repositories that are very active, since you
will probably get feedback on your PR and questions quicker, don't overlook less
active ones, because they would really benefit from people helping out. If your
long-term goal is to achieve a status like "Approver" or "Maintainer",
contributing to less active repositories can accelerate this progression due to
the higher impact your contributions will have. Find out more about membership
status here: [Membership][membership].

For newcomers, looking for issues tagged with "good first issue" within those
repositories is an excellent strategy. These issues are typically designed to be
approachable for new contributors, offering a manageable entry point into the
project.

If you're unsure where to start contributing, documentation is an excellent
starting point, as it directly benefits a wide audience. You can see more
details on how to contribute to documentation here: [Contributing][contrib],
which includes the [localization][localization] efforts.

Another great starting point is to join a Special Interest Group (SIG) within
OpenTelemetry. These groups focus on specific areas of the project. By immersing
yourself in a SIG, you'll gain insights into their current priorities and
identify relevant tasks. Don't feel like you need to speak at those meetings
right away, there is no pressure! You can introduce yourself if you want, but in
general you can simply join, listen in, and determine if the area interests you.
If it does, you can then start chiming in on discussions or bringing your own
topics.

## Substantial contributions

If you're considering a more substantial or novel contribution, it's advisable
to consult with the maintainers of the relevant SIG. They can provide valuable
input and help determine if your proposed task aligns with current project goals
and makes sense for you to undertake at that particular moment.

All OpenTelemetry repositories can be found at [OTel Repositories][repos]. This
page provides an overview of each repository, including the programming
languages used and a brief description.

The majority of OpenTelemetry repositories include a "contributing" tab. This
tab provides repository-specific guidance, covering essential information such
as dependencies, instructions for running tests locally, and other setup
procedures. Should you find any missing information in these contributing
documents, don't hesitate to ask questions on the respective [Slack
channels][slack].

During your contribution journey, you might identify gaps or areas for
improvement in the existing contributing documentation. This presents a valuable
opportunity to contribute by creating a pull request that adds the missing
information. By doing so, you'll not only contribute to the project but also
significantly assist future contributors who may have similar questions.
Documentation contributions are just as important as code contributions.

## Final thoughts

Once you decide what to work on, you can always ask for help, remember that the
OpenTelemetry community is a powerful resource, and there are a lot of people
willing to provide guidance.

If you have ideas on how to improve the overall experience for OpenTelemetry
contributors, we encourage you to share them on the Slack channel
`#otel-contributor-experience`. Your suggestions are highly valued and can help
shape a more welcoming and efficient environment for everyone involved!

Happy coding!
