The OpenTelemetry project is powerful, but let's be honest: managing it in
production can be complex. You're juggling dozens of components, tracking
breaking changes across versions, and trying to optimize pipelines.

What if you could manage this complexity using natural language? What if you had
an assistant that truly understood your collector's and instrumentation
configuration, versions, and can even reason about your telemetry data.

This is the vision behind the new
[OpenTelemetry MCP server project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/pull/3128).
By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we aim to bridge the gap between
Large Language Models (LLMs) and the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.

## We need your help!

Enabling OpenTelemetry to function seamlessly within agentic workflows is an
exciting challenge. We are looking for contributors to help shape the use cases,
roadmap, design, and implementation.

Why contribute?

- Innovate: Work at the intersection of Generative AI and Observability.
- Impact: Help simplify the OpenTelemetry experience for thousands of users.
- Learn: Deepen your knowledge of the OpenTelemetry ecosystem and the emerging
  standard of MCP servers.

## How to participate

- Join the SIG: Attend the
  [OpenTelemetry Developer Experience SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#sig-devex)
  meetings to learn more about the project.
- Code with us: Initially, work on this project will be initially conducted in
  the
  [sig-developer-experience](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-developer-experience)
  repository.
