The OpenTelemetry project is powerful, but let's be honest: managing it in
production can be complex. You're juggling dozens of components, tracking
breaking changes across versions, and trying to optimize pipelines.

What if you could manage this complexity using natural language? What if you had
an assistant that truly understood your collector's and instrumentation
configuration, versions, and even its data?

This is the vision behind the new [OpenTelemetry MCP server project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/pull/3128).

## We need your help!

Enabling the OpenTelemetry to be used in the agentic way is a huge challenge. We need your help to shape the use-case, roadmap, design, and
implementation. The success of this project depends on your contributions!

This project is a great opportunity to learn about the OpenTelemetry ecosystem, MCP servers and simplify the OpenTelemetry experience for thousands of users.
