We are excited to announce the winners of the second **OpenTelemetry Community
Awards**! These awards recognize individuals who have made a notable impact to
the OpenTelemetry project over the past year, whether it's through code,
documentation, project management, outreach, adoption, or simply helping others
answer technical questions on our [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). We
received many nominations from the community, and we are delighted to share the
winners with you.
