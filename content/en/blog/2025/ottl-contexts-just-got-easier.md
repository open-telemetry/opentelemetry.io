Selecting the right OTTL context for running statements can be challenging, even
for experienced users. Choosing the correct option impacts both accuracy and
efficiency, as using higher-level OTTL contexts can avoid unnecessary iterations
through nested lower-level contexts.

To simplify this process, the OpenTelemetry community is excited to announce
OTTL
[context inference](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/transformprocessor/README.md#context-inference)
support for the
[transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/transformprocessor).
This feature removes the need for users to understand the underlying context
concept of OTTL, allowing them to focus solely on their data. It also improves
statement processing efficiency by automatically selecting the most appropriate
OTTL context. This optimization ensures that data transformations are both
accurate and performant.

## How does it work?

Starting with version `0.120.0`, the transform processor supports two new
context-inferred configuration styles. The first one offers a simpler and
flatter approach, while the second closely resembles the existing configuration
format.

### Basic configuration

The
[basic configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/transformprocessor/README.md#basic-config)
style simplifies configuration by allowing users to list all statements
together, without worrying about OTTL contexts or extra configuration
structures. This style support statements from multiple OTTL contexts and does
not require grouping them separately.

To illustrate this, compare the following configuration:

```yaml
metric_statements:
  - context: resource
    statements:
      - keep_keys(attributes, ["host.name"])
  - context: metric
    statements:
      - set(description, "Sum") where type == "Sum"
      - convert_sum_to_gauge() where name == "system.processes.count"
  - context: datapoint
    statements:
      - limit(attributes, 100, ["host.name"])
```

With the new basic configuration style, the same logic is expressed more
concisely by simply providing a list of statements:

```yaml
metric_statements:
  - keep_keys(resource.attributes, ["host.name"])
  - set(metric.description, "Sum") where metric.type == "Sum"
  - convert_sum_to_gauge() where metric.name == "system.processes.count"
  - limit(datapoint.attributes, 100, ["host.name"])
```

This streamlined approach enhances readability and makes configuration more
intuitive. To use this configuration style, all paths in the statements must be
prefixed with their respective OTTL contexts. These prefixes are required for
all context-inferred configurations and serve as hints for selecting the best
match. It also makes statements unambiguous and portable between components
using OTTL.

### Advanced configuration

The context-inferred
[advanced configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/transformprocessor/README.md#advanced-config)
style closely resembles the existing format and allows users to leverage the
benefits of context inference while providing granular control over statement
configurations, such as `error_mode` and `conditions`. For example, consider the
following configuration:

```yaml
metric_statements:
  - context: datapoint
    conditions:
      - resource.attributes["service.name"] == "my.service"
    statements:
      - set(metric.description, "counter") where attributes["my.attr"] == "some"
```

The above can now be written as:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
metric_statements:
  - conditions:
      - resource.attributes["service.name"] == "my.service"
    statements:
      - set(metric.description, "counter") where datapoint.attributes["my.attr"] == "some"
```

In this example, the `context` value is omitted and is automatically inferred to
`datapoint`, as it is the only OTTL context present in the statements that
supports parsing both `datapoint` and `metric` data.

If we update the above configuration removing the `datapoint` usage:

```yaml
metric_statements:
  - conditions:
      - resource.attributes["service.name"] == "my.service"
    statements:
      - set(metric.description, "counter")
```

The context inferrer would select the `metric` OTTL context instead, since no
data points are accessed. Although it would be possible to run the statements
using the `datapoint` OTTL context, `metric` is the most efficient option.

### Which configuration style should I choose?

The [basic configuration](#basic-configuration) style is best suited for
scenarios where simplicity and ease of use are paramount. It is ideal for simple
use cases where your configuration needs are straightforward and do not require
the use of additional configurations keys, allowing you to quickly set up your
statements with minimal effort and without needing to understand the underlying
concept of OTTL contexts.

The [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) style is more detailed and
allows the use of additional configuration keys such as `error_mode` and
`conditions`. It supports statements from multiple OTTL contexts. However,
unlike the basic configuration style, it may require splitting them into
separate configuration groups (see
[advanced config](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/transformprocessor#advanced-config)).
In terms of performance, the advanced configuration is slightly faster than the
basic configuration, making it a better choice for complex scenarios or
configurations with a high number of statements.
