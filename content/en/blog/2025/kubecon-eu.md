The OpenTelemetry governance and technical committees, along with the project's
maintainers, invite you to join them and other members of the OpenTelemetry
community at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe][] ([registration][]) and at the
co-located [Observability Day] in London from April 1 to 4, 2025.

This post covers all currently scheduled activities related to OpenTelemetry
that are happening during KubeCon. Check back for updates before the start of
the conference!

## OpenTelemetry Contribfest

Join the OpenTelemetry maintainers for
[OpenTelemetry Contribfest](https://sched.co/1tcyB)! This hands-on session is a
favorite for new contributors. You can choose between several opportunities to
contribute&mdash;Collector, Go, Java, JavaScript, and more&mdash;with support
and guidance from maintainers in these project areas to help you get started.

## OpenTelemetry Observatory

Drop by and say _"Hi!"_ at OpenTelemetry Observatory presented by Splunk in the
Expo Hall. This will be a place for informal chats, meetups, and other
discussions led by OpenTelemetry community members and maintainers.

<!-- For the activity schedule, see the [OTel Observatory Calendar](https://shorturl.at/qEUX1). -->

Note that the Observatory might show up as "Splunk Activation Booth" on the
event map.

Activity schedule coming soon. Check back in the coming weeks for updates!

<!-- If you’d like to participate and lead a discussion or short presentation, reach
out to the
[OpenTelemetry End User Working Group](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ)
to indicate your interest. -->

You can help us improve the project by sharing your thoughts and feedback about
your OpenTelemetry adoption, implementation, and usage.

<!-- To join a feedback session, book online below. All times in Central European
Time (CET).

- **March 20th, 11:45-12:45:**

[OTel YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@otel-official). -->

We will create action items from your comments as appropriate. Check
[#otel-sig-end-user] in CNCF's Slack instance for results and action item
updates to come after KubeCon EU.

<!-- Back by popular demand! We'll be recording
[Humans of OTel interviews](/blog/2023/humans-of-otel/) at the OTel Observatory.
If you'd like to share your experiences as an OpenTelemetry practitioner or
maintainer,
[sign up for an interview session](https://calendly.com/otel-euwg/humans-of-otel). -->
