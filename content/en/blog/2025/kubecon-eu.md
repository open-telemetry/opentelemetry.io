The OpenTelemetry governance and technical committees, along with the project's
maintainers, invite you to join them and other members of the OpenTelemetry
community at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe][] ([registration]) and at the
co-located [Observability Day] in London from April 1 to 4, 2025.

This post covers all currently scheduled activities related to OpenTelemetry
that are happening during KubeCon. Check back for updates before the start of
the conference!

## OpenTelemetry Contribfest

Join the OpenTelemetry maintainers for
[OpenTelemetry Contribfest](https://sched.co/1tcyB)! This hands-on session is a
favorite for new contributors. You can choose between several opportunities to
contribute&mdash;Collector, Go, Java, JavaScript, and more&mdash;with support
and guidance from maintainers in these project areas to help you get started.

## OpenTelemetry Observatory Booth {#opentelemetry-observatory}

Drop by and say _"Hi!"_ at **OpenTelemetry Observatory booth** in the Expo
Hall[^1], courtesy of [Splunk]. This will be a place for informal chats,
meetups, and other discussions led by OpenTelemetry community members and
maintainers.

[^1]:
    The Observatory booth may show up as a "Splunk activation zone" in the event
    map.

For the **activity schedule**, see the [OTel Observatory Calendar][]. If you’d
like to participate or lead a discussion or short presentation, reach out to the
[OpenTelemetry End User Working Group][] to indicate your interest.

You can also help us improve OTel by sharing your thoughts and feedback about
your OpenTelemetry adoption, implementation, and usage experiences. We will
create action items from your comments as appropriate, and post results to
[#otel-sig-end-user] after the conference.
