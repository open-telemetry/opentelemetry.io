## Introduction

Hello world! I’m Richard Chukwu, a Computer Engineering graduate from the
University of Benin in Nigeria. My journey into tech has been fueled by a blend
of curiosity and an unwavering commitment to growth. These are the pillars that
not only uphold my personal values but also form the foundation of my
professional aspirations.

I still remember the nervous excitement I felt when I received the
[email](https://x.com/RichardChukwu_/status/1862390957217333461) confirming my
selection for
[Outreachy](https://richardchukwu.hashnode.dev/outreachy-internship-introduction-first-day-of-my-internship#heading-determination).
It was a moment of validation, but also one filled with uncertainty. Could I
truly make an impact in open source? Would I be able to contribute meaningfully
to a project as vast and complex as OpenTelemetry? Now, as I wrap up this
incredible journey, I can say with confidence that the experience has been
transformative in ways I never imagined.

## Overcoming Fear: Imposter Syndrome Didn’t Win

One of my biggest fears stepping into Outreachy was imposter syndrome.
OpenTelemetry is a widely used project, and I worried about keeping up with
seasoned contributors. However, I quickly realized that the open source
community thrives on collaboration, mentorship, and shared learning. My mentor
and the community members were incredibly supportive, always willing to guide me
when I felt stuck. I learned that asking questions and seeking help is not a
weakness—it’s how we grow.

## A Highlight: Seeing My Work Make an Impact

One of the most fulfilling moments of my internship was when my
[first major contribution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang/pull/825)—a
detailed setup guide for OpenTelemetry Erlang contributors was merged. What
seemed like a simple task at first turned into a deep dive into improving
developer onboarding, documenting tribal knowledge, and making contributions
more accessible. Seeing community members reference my work and use it to get
started was an incredibly rewarding feeling. It reminded me why I love open
source—it's about creating something that empowers others.

## Growth in Skills and Confidence

This internship stretched my technical and communication skills in ways I hadn’t
expected. On the technical side, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- OpenTelemetry’s instrumentation and architecture.
- Observability and its role in modern distributed systems.
- Documentation best practices and how to bridge the gap between technical
  complexity and accessibility.

On the communication side, I learned how to:

- Engage in meaningful discussions in GitHub issues and PRs.
- Synthesize feedback from multiple contributors and maintainers.
- Document processes in a way that is both clear and effective for a global
  audience.

Most importantly, Outreachy gave me the confidence to contribute to open source
projects beyond this internship. I now see myself as part of the broader open
source ecosystem, and I’m excited to continue making meaningful contributions.

## Project Contributions and Future Directions

During my tenure, I completed the creation of the
[setup guide for the development of OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-contributor-experience/issues/31)
and contributed to refining existing documentation. Moving forward, I aim to
continue my involvement with the OpenTelemetry community, focusing on expanding
resources that facilitate contributor engagement.

## The Role of My Mentor

My mentor, [Marylia Gutierrez](https://github.com/maryliag), played a crucial
role in my journey. She not only provided guidance on technical issues but also
encouraged me to think critically and independently. She fostered a welcoming
environment where I felt comfortable experimenting, failing, and learning from
my mistakes. Her patience and willingness to share knowledge made a lasting
impact on me.

## What’s Next?

As I complete my Outreachy internship with CNCF OpenTelemetry, I’m looking ahead
to my next steps. I want to continue working in cloud native technologies and
observability, contributing to open source projects that improve developer
experience and system reliability. I’m actively seeking opportunities where I
can apply my skills, whether it’s in open source advocacy, cloud engineering, or
observability solutions.

To anyone considering [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), I say: go for it!
This internship has been a gateway to new opportunities, networks, and a deeper
belief in my abilities. I’m grateful for the experience and excited for what the
future holds.
