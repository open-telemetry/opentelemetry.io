Since its founding, OpenTelemetry has had [thousands of contributors][3] from all around the world,
including end users, vendors and students. [Last summer][1] some members of the OpenTelemetry
project came together to create [Contributor Experience SIG][2]; a SIG focused on improving the
experience of contributors to the OpenTelemetry Project, to make sure contributors of all types can
have a great experience. Since then, the SIG has been working on a number of initiatives, including
an [Outreachy project][5] to [create up to date contributor documentation][4].

To inform future initiatives and help us understand the current state of the contributor experience,
we are launching today our first official Contributor Experience Survey. If you have ever
contributed to the project, be it with code, documentation or in a different way, we want to hear
from you! The survey should take between five and ten minutes, and is **open from February 17th up
until March 17th**.

The survey is anonymous; only [maintainers of the Contributor Experience SIG][7] will see your full
individual answers. We will share an aggregate analysis of the survey results once completed, with a
special focus to avoid data re-identification.

You can **access the survey [here][6]**. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to
Pablo Baeyens on the CNCF Slack or via the email listed on the first page of the survey.
