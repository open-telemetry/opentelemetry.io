The [OpenTelemetry End User Working Group][] has heard feedback from users who
desire a vendor-agnostic space to discuss adopting OpenTelemetry, so we’re
excited to announce two new ways for you to connect with other users of the
project and share best practices, a synchronous monthly discussion group and a
new private slack channel. These forums will bring together operations and
development engineers from different organizations to discuss challenges and
solutions to achieving ubiquitous observability. Share successes and failures,
discover best practices, and meet others who are also on a journey to implement
observability powered by OpenTelemetry.

### Monthly Discussion Group

- Monthly hour long sessions via google meet -- all are welcome!
- We use a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) format where discussion topics
  are generated and democratically selected by the group at the start of the
  meeting. Topics are rigorously time-boxed by a facilitator.
- [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)
  applies. Meetings will not be recorded.
- The first meeting is on the OpenTelemetry calendar, scheduled for July 14th
  2022 at 9AM PST. We intend to alternate months between APAC friendly and AMER
  friendly timezones, we will re-evaluate this plan depending on attendance and
  feedback.

### Slack Channel (#otel-endusers)

- Confirm your agreement with channel [Code of Conduct][] and reach out to Reese
  Lee or Rynn Mancuso on CNCF slack for an invite to `#otel-endusers`.
- [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)
  applies.
- Troubleshooting or tactical SDK specific questions are still best directed to
  individual SIG channels or the
  [#opentelemetry](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q) channel.
- Vendor specific questions are still best directed to vendor channels, or if it
  doesn’t exist
  [#otel-vendor](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C031SAMGV2A)

### Topics

This group is what its members make it--whatever is of interest to the group is
fair game! But here are some of the kinds of things we expect will be on the
table:

- Refactoring with telemetry
- What is company X doing with OpenTelemetry?
- Correlating multiple observability signals
- Maintaining and scaling OpenTelemetry deployments
- Writing custom instrumentation

### Questions

**Is this group only for OpenTelemetry end users?**

No! Anyone is welcome to join and discuss their journey to observability. This
group is hosted by the OpenTelemetry Community End-User Working Group, so we
expect most participants will be from organizations that are evaluating or using
OpenTelemetry.

**I have questions about this, who can I reach out to?**

You can find members of the End User Working Group in
[#otel-user-research](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ).
