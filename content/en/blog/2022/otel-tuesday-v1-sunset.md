When we started running OpenTelemetry Tuesday live streams back in 2019, the
world was a lot different than it is today. Back then, it was very challenging
for external participants and observers to understand what was going on with the
overall status of the project. There weren't as many good resources for learning
about OpenTelemetry, or for figuring out how to contribute.

However, the project has matured by leaps and bounds since we started, and the
associated rate of change and lack of discoverability that drove the stream as a
concept has lessened. There's newsletters, Twitter feeds, and a thriving social
community on the CNCF Slack for OpenTelemetry updates.

With this in mind, we'll be winding down the OpenTelemetry Tuesday stream going
forward. That doesn't mean it's gone forever, or that we wouldn't be willing to
bring it back, but the format just really wasn't giving a lot to the community
at this point. If you're a content creator that's interested in working on this
in the future, please come find us in the #otel-comms channel on Slack!

Last, but not least, I'd like to extend a huge thanks to everyone that's helped
host or guest on the stream in the past. Until next time, signing off.
