Since July, end users have been getting together to discuss their OpenTelemetry
adoption and implementation practices in a vendor-netural space known as the
[Monthly Discussion Groups](/community/end-user/discussion-group/)
(also referenced as the End User Discussion Groups).

Previously, they were only available in the EMEA and AMER regions; the End User
Working Group is pleased to announce that **APAC sessions will now be available,
starting in January 2023**!

## The what
As mentioned above, these Discussion Groups are monthly meetings for end users
to discuss the challenges they're facing in their OTel implementations and to
learn from each other, as well as to talk about the project itself and what is
working, what isn't, and what they'd like to see.

We encourage you to attend and ask questions to learn how other users have
implemented OpenTelemetry in their organizations, resolved common issues, and
more. Example topics that have been discussed include tail sampling, collector
scaling, and OpAMP; there really is no limit to the topics! We simply ask that
you be respectful and abide by the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule).

## The why
This group started as a result of direct feedback from end users in the community!
Past participants have shared with us that these have been helpful and valuable
for them as they migrate their observability instrumentation to OpenTelemetry.

Additionally, the End User Working Group is also improving the process to share
any collected user feedback\* with the appropriate project maintainers to help
improve the user experience and increase adoption.

\*Information shared in the groups can be discussed publicly, but **not** the
identity of the person who said it or their affiliation.

## The when
If this is your first time hearing about these meetings, you are invited to
participate in any of the upcoming sessions that fit your schedule. Look for
the meetings by filtering them in one of the community's publicly available
[calendars](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar), and duplicate
the event to your own. There will also be periodic reminders in the general CNCF
Slack `#opentelemetry` channel.
