The OpenTelemetry project is proud to announce the winners of the 2022
OpenTelemetry Governance Committee (GC) election! Before we get into the
results, I'd like to share some statistics about the election!

This year, 513 project members were eligible to vote. Of those, 219 cast
ballots, for a participation rate of nearly 43%! For comparison, the 2021
election saw 169 ballots cast with 386 eligible voters. Participation was
roughly flat year-over-year, and we're thrilled that we've welcomed so many new
project members and maintained a high participation rate.

With that out of the way, please join me in congratulating
[Alolita Sharma](https://github.com/alolita),
[Daniel Dyla](https://github.com/dyladan), and
[Morgan McLean](https://github.com/mtwo) on their re-election! They will be
joined by long-time contributor and maintainer of OpenTelemetry Java
Instrumentation [Trask Stalnaker](https://github.com/trask)! All will serve a
two-year term.

We'd like to thank everyone who participated -- candidates, voters, and the
election organizers -- for their efforts. You can find the
[full results of the election here](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/76558134-3384-11ed-8688-02871af94755/view).
