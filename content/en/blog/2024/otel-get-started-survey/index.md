Getting started with new technologies can be hard, which is why we try to meet our end-users where they are. As a part of that goal, we ([the OpenTelemetry End-User SIG](/community/end-user/)) recently surveyed the community to find out how we can best help our users get started with OpenTelemetry. The 104 responses we received will help drive improvements in enablement content from the community as well as vendors. 

Check out the results!


## Key Takeaways
* No matter their level of OTel experience, folks would like to see the following:
    1. Comprehensive documentation (67.3% of respondents)
    2. Reference implementations for instrumentation (65.3% of respondents)
    3. Detailed tutorials (63.4% of respondents)
* Respondents are mostly working with containers, with 79.8% of respondents using Kubernetes and 63.5% of respondents using Docker
* Over 83% of respondents stated that the Traces Specification, Instrumentation APIs & SDKs, and Metrics Specification were the most important in their OTel journey.


## Detailed insights
### Q: What technologies are you using when setting up your observability journey?

### Q: What languages are you using in your organization?

[JavaScript](/docs/languages/js/), [Java](/docs/languages/java/), [Go](/docs/languages/go/), and [Python](/docs/languages/python/) are the most widely used languages, they are being utilized by over 50% of the respondents.

Other languages used included Scala, TypeScript, Erlang/Elixir, Perl, R, Lua, Matlab, Julia, Haskell, COBOL, Kotlin, and SAS.

### Q: What resources do you wish you had when getting started with OpenTelemetry?

Depending on where in their observability journey they prefer different resources: 


* Those who are learning about observability and those who are setting up an observability practice want comprehensive documentation and detailed tutorials and videos. 
* Those who have a well-established observability practice prefer reference implementations for instrumentation as well as comprehensive documentation.
