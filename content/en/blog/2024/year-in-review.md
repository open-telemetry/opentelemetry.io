As 2024 draws to a close, we reflect on the year and share some insights and
accomplishments from [SIG Communications][Comms meetings], the team responsible
for managing this website, blog, and documentation.

## Key achievements of 2024

Several key accomplishments stand out in our efforts to make OpenTelemetry
documentation more accessible, user-friendly, and impactful for our global
community.

### Multilingual documentation <i class="fa-solid fa-language"></i> {#multilingual-documentation}

A major accomplishment this year was achieving multilingual support with the
launch of our [localized documentation](/blog/2024/docs-localized/). Thanks to
the efforts of localization teams, over 120 pages were translated from English
into other languages. The available translations include:

- [Chinese](/zh/)
- [French](/fr/)
- [Japanese](/ja/)
- [Portuguese](/pt/)
- [Spanish](/es/)

A big thank you to everyone who contributed to this initiative. These
translations make OpenTelemetry more accessible, enhancing the user experience
for our global audience.

### Information Architecture (IA) improvements <i class="fa-solid fa-sitemap"></i> {#ia-improvements}

To **improve readership experience** and make OpenTelemetry **documentation more
intuitive and accessible**, we undertook important updates to our Information
Architecture (IA) this year. These changes were driven by the need to better
organize content, clarify the purpose of key sections, and provide a more
structured and user-friendly experience for end-users and developers.

Key IA updates include:

- Renaming the `Instrumentation` section to
  [Language APIs & SDKs](/docs/languages/) to better reflect its purpose and set
  clearer expectations for users.
- Moving `Automatic Instrumentation` into the new
  [Zero-code Instrumentation](/docs/zero-code/) section to more clearly
  distinguish between instrumentation APIs & SDKs and tools like the Java agent,
  used to inject telemetry.
- Following these updates, the Java SIG [proposed] and [reorganized their
  documentation][java-reorg], introducing substantial improvements to the
  structure and clarity of the content. The bulk of this effort is reflected in
  these PRs:

  - [Refactor Java SDK and configuration #4966][#4966]
  - [Refactor Java instrumentation #5276][#5276]
  - [Move performance to Java agent, merge Javadoc into API page #5590][#5590]

  Kudos to [Jack Berg] and the [Java SIG] for their exemplary leadership in
  improving language-SIG documentation!

Next year, we aim to redesign how OpenTelemetry is introduced to beginners,
ensuring a smoother and more accessible learning experience. If you're
passionate about making OpenTelemetry easier to understand and use, we’d love
your contributions &mdash; [join us][#2427] in this collaborative effort.

## Year in numbers <i class="fa-solid fa-chart-pie"></i> {#year-in-numbers}

### Contributions

In [December 2022], we started [monthly releases] of the website so that we
could regularly summarize activities and highlight significant contributions.
These releases allow us to track progress over time and perform long-term
comparisons.

For instance, comparing the periods [December 2022 to November 2023] and
[December 2023 to November 2024], we observed an upward trend in contributions:

- **Commits** increased 33% from 1,011 to 1,340
- **Contributors** grew 15% from 92 to 106
- The only metric that declined was the **number of files changed**, which
  decreased from 1,864 to 1,624 (13%)

Since the repository’s inception in April 2019, the community has seen
remarkable growth, with:

- 3,824 merged pull requests (3,982 commits) by
- 768 contributors

Thank you to every contributor for helping to build and improve the
OpenTelemetry website. Your efforts make a difference!
