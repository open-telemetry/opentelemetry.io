We are happy to announce that the OpenTelemetry website is available in
multiple languages! Localization teams have already started to translate website
pages into [Portuguese](/pt), [Chinese](/zh), [Japanese](/ja) and [Spanish](/es).

The OpenTelemetry project has grown to include contributors and users from all
over the world. Making the website available in multiple languages is an
important step for ensuring that everyone, regardless of their native language,
can contribute to the project. We are also thrilled that this initiative gives
end users access to multilingual documentation, making it easier to learn and
understand OpenTelemetry.

To access the website in your preferred language, use the language
selector at the top right of the page.


We invite you to contribute to this effort. You can find fellow localization
contributors in the
[#otel-docs-localization](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C076RUAGP37)
Slack channel. If you are fluent in a language that is supported already, you
can help by authoring or reviewing translations. If your language is not yet
supported and you'd like to help translate, 
[reach out to us by raising an issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/new?title=Add+%3Cyour%20language%3E+(%3Cyour+code%3E)+version+of+website+pages&body=%3C!--+please+provide+github+handles+of+at+least+2+people+that+will+work+on+this+translation+project%20--%3E).

Your contributions can make a meaningful impact!

We thank all contributors for making this possible, and we look
forward to seeing how these new language options improve the OpenTelemetry user
experience.
