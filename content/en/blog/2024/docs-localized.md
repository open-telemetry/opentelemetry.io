We are happy to announce that the OpenTelemetry documentation now supports
multiple languages! As of today teams have started to translate our resources in
Portuguese (pt), Chinese (zh) and Japanese (ja).

Our project has grown into a project with contributors and users spanning every
corner of the world. Therefor, making our documentation available in multiple
languages is an important step to ensure, that everyone, regardless of their
native language, can access and contribute to OpenTelemetry.

We are thrilled that with this update, we enable end users to access our
documentation in their native language which makes understanding and learning
OpenTelemetry much easier.

To access the documentation in your preferred language, use the language
selector at the top right of the page.

This is just the beginning! We have a team starting to translate the
documentation into Spanish (es), and we expect even more languages in the
future!

We invite you to contribute to this effort! If you are fluent in a language that
is supported already, you can help by authoring or reviewing translations. If
your language is not yet supported, please reach out to us, by raising an issue.

Your contributions can make a meaningful impact!

We thank all contributors that have helped to make this possible, and we are
looking forward to see how these new language options will make our project even
better.
