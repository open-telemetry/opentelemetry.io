We are happy to announce that the OpenTelemetry website is available in multiple
languages! Localization teams have already started to translate website pages
into [Chinese](/zh), [Japanese](/ja), [Portuguese](/pt), and [Spanish](/es).

The OpenTelemetry project has grown to include contributors and users from all
over the world. Making the website available in multiple languages is an
important step for ensuring that everyone, regardless of their native language,
can contribute to the project. We are also thrilled that this initiative gives
end users access to multilingual documentation, making it easier to learn and
understand OpenTelemetry.

To access the website in your preferred language, use the language selector at
the top right of the page.

We invite you to contribute to this effort. You can find fellow localization
contributors in the
[#otel-docs-localization](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C076RUAGP37)
Slack channel. If you are fluent in a language that is supported already, you
can help by authoring or reviewing translations. If your language is not yet
supported and you'd like to help translate,
[create an issue](<https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/new?title=Add+%3CYOUR%20LANGUAGE%3E+(%3CYOUR+CODE%3E)+version+of+website+pages&body=%3C!--+Provide+github+handles+of+at+least+2+people+that+will+work+on+this+translation+project%20--%3E>).

Your contributions can make a meaningful impact!

We thank all contributors for making this possible, and we look forward to
seeing how these new language options improve the OpenTelemetry user experience.
