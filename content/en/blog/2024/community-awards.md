OpenTelemetry is a community-driven project, fueled by a group of awesome humans
who are actively revolutionizing the field of observability with their
contributions. Whether it's through code, documentation, project management,
outreach, adoption, or simply helping others answer technical questions on our
[CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/), we want to recognize these contributions
and the people behind them -- because we're all human, and we all like that warm
fuzzy feeling of appreciation.

We are thrilled to announce the first-ever **OpenTelemetry Community Awards**!
This is your chance to nominate individuals who have made a notable impact to
OpenTelemetry over the past year. _Everyone_ can nominate _anyone_ in the
community, be they a contributor, end-user, or community member.

Submit nominations using
[this Google Form](https://forms.gle/ioqFNmDhKNYYAtRs7).

Although we require sign-in to ensure only one form submission per person,
nominations are completely anonymous. You can nominate up to five people per
submission, and nominations will be open **until midnight UTC on November 8th,
2024**. Winners will be announced at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North
America 2024.
