OpenTelemetry is a community-driven project. A community of awesome humans who
are actively revolutionizing the field of observability with their
contributions. Whether it's through code, documentation, project management,
outreach, adoption, or simply helping others answer technical questions on our
[CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). We want to **recognize these contributions
and the people behind them**, because we're all human, and we all like that warm
fuzzy feeling of appreciation.

We are thrilled to announce the first-ever **OpenTelemetry Community Awards**!
This is your chance to nominate individuals who have made a notable impact to
OpenTelemetry over the past year. _Everyone_ can nominate _anyone_ in the
community, be it a contributor, end-user, or community member.

Please submit nominations **via the following
[Google Form](https://forms.gle/ioqFNmDhKNYYAtRs7).**

Although we require sign-in to ensure one nomination only per person,
nominations are completely anonymous. You can nominate up to five people, and
nominations will be open **until midnight UTC on November 8th, 2024**. Winners
will be announced at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024.
