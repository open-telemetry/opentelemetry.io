In 2023 we published the
[first official project roadmap](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/31b3c026dad96e14eb86259fb9a9e22cf3e85441/roadmap.md)
for OpenTelemetry. We created it to provide direction to new contributors, to
the public and end users who want to know what's coming next, and to attempt to
channel the bulk of our concentration and development efforts into the areas
where they are most needed.

A year later, we want to look back on the things that have been accomplished
since last year, and we want to provide a new roadmap for the year ahead of us.
