We are delighted to announce the results of the
[2024 OpenTelemetry Governance Committee Election](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/elections/2024/governance-committee-election.md)!

The OpenTelemetry project continues to bring together an exceptionally vibrant
community, who are shaping the future of observability with their contributions.
This year, active contributors have shown their commitment again by
participating in our election process, and they've done it in great numbers.

701 contributors were eligible to vote this year, and 299 of them cast their
ballot. This is a new record for the project! With a participation rate of 43%,
it represents a significant increase from the 2023 election, where 206 ballots
were cast with 616 eligible voters, proof of OpenTelemetry's healthy growth and
engagement.

Four positions were up for election in this year's Governance Committee
selection process. Without further ado, please join us in congratulating
[Alolita Sharma](https://github.com/alolita),
[Morgan McLean](https://github.com/mtwo),
[Pablo Baeyens Fern√°ndez](https://github.com/mx-psi), and
[Trask Stalnaker](https://github.com/trask)! All will serve a two-year term.

We'd like to thank everyone who participated -- candidates, voters, and the
election organizers -- for their efforts. You can find the
[full results of the election here](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/176e7ca8-647d-11ef-9b9a-2a30e2a223da/view).
