Join the OpenTelemetry project maintainers and members of the governance and
technical committees at the [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit +
AI_dev] conference in Hong Kong from August 21 to 23, 2024.

Read on to learn about all the OpenTelemetry events at KubeCon China 2024.

This post will be updated as we receive notice of other activities. Check
back before the conference begins!

## Top-level heading

Top-level headings start at **level 2**. This means, that your post should not
include `# headings` for top-level headings but `## headings` instead.

## Paragraphs

Wrap paragraph text at 80 characters, this helps make git diffs (which is line
based) more useful. If you don't want to bother with that, then just run the
markdown formatter (see below).

## Images

If you use images, make sure that your blog post is located in it's own
directory. Put the images into the same directory.

If you have an image stored at `content/en/blog/2024/imagename.png`, you can
reference them like the following:

![Provide a good image description for improved accessibility](imagename.png)

## Markdown formatter

Before submitting a new commit run the formatter over your file:

```sh
npm run format
```

Happy writing!

ignore the `Error in user YAML` at the top of this page.
