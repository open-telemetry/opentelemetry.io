## OpenTelemetry Project Booth

Drop by and say _"Hi!"_ at the OpenTelemetry project booth in the KubeCon NA
Project Pavilion. If you’re lucky, you may even pick up some OpenTelemetry swag.

[Pavilion hours](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/project-opportunities/)
for all projects during KubeCon are as follows:

- Wednesday, March 20th • 10:45 - 20:00 (includes KubeCrawl + Cloud NativeFest

You can help us improve the project by sharing your thoughts and feedback about
your OpenTelemetry adoption, implementation, and usage. We will create action
items from your comments as appropriate. Check [#otel-user-research][] in CNCF's
Slack instance for results and action item updates to come after KubeCon EU.

## OpenTelemetry Observatory

In addition to our booth at the Project Pavilion, please visit the OpenTelemetry
Observatory presented by Splunk in the Expo Hall! This will be a place for
informal chats, meetups, and other discussions led by OpenTelemetry community
members and maintainers. If you’d like to participate and lead a discussion or
short presentation, please reach out to the OpenTelemetry End User Working Group
to indicate your interest.

Come join us to listen, learn, and get involved in OpenTelemetry.

See you in Paris!
