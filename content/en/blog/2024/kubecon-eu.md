## OpenTelemetry Observatory

Drop by and say _"Hi!"_ at OpenTelemetry Observatory presented by Splunk in the
Expo Hall. This will be a place for informal chats, meetups, and other
discussions led by OpenTelemetry community members and maintainers. For the
activity schedule, see the
[OTel Observatory Calendar](https://shorturl.at/qEUX1).

If you’d like to participate and lead a discussion or short presentation, reach
out to the
