Besides **code-based** instrumentation using the
[language-specific APIs and SDKs](/docs/languages/) the OpenTelemetry project
provides a set of solutions for **automatic** (or **zero-code**) and
**assisted** instrumentation.

You can learn about the difference between the three solutions and about their
different use cases on the
[concept page about Instrumentation](/concepts/instrumentation/).
