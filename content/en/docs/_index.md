OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-source
[Observability](concepts/observability-primer/#what-is-observability) framework
for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as
[traces](concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces),
[metrics](concepts/observability-primer/#reliability--metrics),
[logs](concepts/observability-primer/#logs). As an industry-standard, it is
[natively supported by a number of vendors](/ecosystem/vendors/).
