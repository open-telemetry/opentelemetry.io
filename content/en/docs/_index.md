OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-source [Observability](concepts/observability-primer/#what-is-observability) framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as [traces](concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces), [metrics](concepts/observability-primer/#reliability--metrics), [logs](concepts/observability-primer/#logs). As an industry-standard it is [natively supported by a number of vendors](/vendors).
