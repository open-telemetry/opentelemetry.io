OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open source
[Observability](concepts/observability-primer/#what-is-observability) framework
for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as
[traces](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/),
[metrics](/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/),
[logs](/docs/concepts/signals/logs/). As an industry-standard, it is
[supported by 40+ observability vendors](/ecosystem/vendors/), integrated by
many [libraries, services and apps](/ecosystem/integrations) and adopted by a
[number of end-users](/ecosystem/adopters).
