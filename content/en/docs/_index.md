OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-source
[Observability](concepts/observability-primer/#what-is-observability) framework
for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as
[traces](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/),
[metrics](/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/),
[logs](/docs/concepts/signals/logs/). As an industry-standard, it is
[natively supported by a number of vendors](/ecosystem/vendors/).
