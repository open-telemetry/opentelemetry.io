OpenTelemetry defines [Semantic Conventions](/docs/specs/semconv/) (sometimes
called Semantic Attributes) that specify common names for different kinds of
operations and data. The benefit of using Semantic Conventions is in following a
common naming scheme that can be standardized across a codebase, libraries, and
platforms.

Semantic Conventions are available for traces, metrics, logs, and resources:

- [Trace Semantic Conventions](/docs/specs/semconv/general/trace/)
- [Metric Semantic Conventions](/docs/specs/semconv/general/metrics/)
- [Log Semantic Conventions](/docs/specs/semconv/general/logs/)
- [Resource Semantic Conventions](/docs/specs/semconv/resource/)
