  A distribution, not to be confused with a fork, is customized version of an
  OpenTelemetry component.

The OpenTelemetry projects consists of multiple [components](../components) that
support multiple [signals](../signals). The reference implementation of
OpenTelemetry is available as:

- [Language-specific instrumentation libraries](../instrumentation)
- A [Collector binary](/docs/concepts/components/#collector)

Any reference implementation can be customized as a distribution.

## What is a distribution?

A distribution is a customized version of an OpenTelemetry component. A
distribution is a wrapper around an upstream OpenTelemetry repository with some
customizations. Distributions are not to be confused with forks.

Customizations in a distribution may include:

- Scripts to ease use or customize use for a specific backend or vendor
- Changes to default settings required for a backend, vendor, or end-user
- Additional packaging options that may be vendor or end-user specific
- Test, performance, and security coverage beyond what OpenTelemetry provides
- Additional capabilities beyond what OpenTelemetry provides
- Less capabilities from what OpenTelemetry provides

Distributions broadly fall into the following categories:

- **"Pure":** These distributions provide the same functionality as upstream and
  are 100% compatible. Customizations typically enhance the ease of use or
  packaging. These customizations may be backend, vendor, or end-user specific.
- **"Plus":** These distributions provide added functionalities on top of
  upstream through additional components. Examples include instrumentation
  libraries or vendor exporters not upstreamed to the OpenTelemetry project.
- **"Minus":** These distributions provide a subset of functionality from
  upstream. Examples of this include the removal of instrumentation libraries or
  receivers, processors, exporters, or extensions found in the OpenTelemetry
  Collector project. These distributions may be provided to increase
  supportability and security considerations.

## Who can create a distribution?

Anyone can create a distribution. Today, several [vendors](/ecosystem/vendors/)
offer [distributions](/ecosystem/distributions/). In addition, end-users can
consider creating a distribution if they want to use components in the
[Registry](/ecosystem/registry/) that are not upstreamed to the OpenTelemetry
project.

## Contribution or distribution?

Before you read on and learn how you can create your own distribution, ask
yourself if your additions on top of an OpenTelemetry component would be
beneficial for everyone and therefore should be included in the reference
implementations:

- Can your scripts for "ease of use" be generalized?
- Can your changes to default settings be the better option for everyone?
- Are your additional packaging options really specific?
- Might your test, performance and security coverage work with the reference
  implementation as well?
- Have you checked with the community if your additional capabilities could be
  part of the standard?

## Creating your own distribution

### Collector

A guide on how to create your own distribution is available in this blog post:
["Building your own OpenTelemetry Collector distribution"](https://medium.com/p/42337e994b63)

If you are building your own distribution, the
[OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder)
might be a good starting point.

### Language specific instrumentation libraries

There are language specific extensibility mechanisms to customize the
instrumentation libraries:

- [Java agent](/docs/zero-code/java/agent/extensions)

## Follow the guidelines

When using OpenTelemetry project collateral such as logo and name for your
distribution, make sure that you are in line with the [OpenTelemetry Marketing
Guidelines for Contributing Organizations][guidelines].

The OpenTelemetry project does not certify distributions at this time. In the
future, OpenTelemetry may certify distributions and partners similarly to the
Kubernetes project. When evaluating a distribution, ensure using the
distribution does not result in vendor lock-in.

> Any support for a distribution comes from the distribution authors and not the
> OpenTelemetry authors.
