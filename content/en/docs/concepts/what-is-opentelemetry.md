OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed
for the creation and management of _telemetry data_ such as traces, metrics, and
logs. The project provides a vendor-agnostic implementation that can be
configured to send telemetry data to the backend(s) of your choice. It supports
a variety of popular open-source projects including Jaeger and Prometheus.

## Why you need OpenTelemetry and what it can do

In cloud-native technology stacks, distributed and polyglot architectures are
the norm. Distributed architectures introduce a variety of operational
challenges including how to solve availability and performance issues quickly.
These challenges have led to the rise of observability.

Telemetry data is needed to power observability products. Traditionally,
telemetry data has been provided by either open-source projects or commercial
vendors. With a lack of standardization, the net result is the lack of data
portability and the burden on the user to maintain the instrumentation.

The OpenTelemetry project solves these problems by providing a single,
vendor-agnostic solution. The project has broad industry support and adoption
from cloud providers, vendors and end users.

OpenTelemetry provides you with:

- A single, vendor-agnostic instrumentation library per language with support
  for both automatic and manual instrumentation.
- A single collector binary that can be deployed in a variety of ways including
  as an agent or gateway.
- An end-to-end implementation to generate, emit, collect, process and export
  telemetry data.
- Full control of your data with the ability to send data to multiple
  destinations in parallel through configuration.
- Open-standard semantic conventions to ensure vendor-agnostic data collection
- The ability to support multiple context propagation formats in parallel to
  assist with migrating as standards evolve.
- A path forward no matter where you are on your observability journey. With
  support for a variety of open-source and commercial protocols, format and
  context propagation mechanisms as well as providing shims to the OpenTracing
  and OpenCensus projects, it is easy to adopt OpenTelemetry.

## What OpenTelemetry is not

OpenTelemetry is not an observability back-end like Jaeger or Prometheus.
Instead, it supports exporting data to a variety of open-source and commercial
back-ends. It provides a pluggable architecture so additional technology
protocols and formats can be easily added.
