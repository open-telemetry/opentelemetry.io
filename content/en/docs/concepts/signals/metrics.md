A **metric** is a **measurement** about a service, captured at runtime.
Logically, the moment of capturing one of these measurements is known as a
**metric event** which consists not only of the measurement itself, but the time
that it was captured and associated metadata.

Application and request metrics are important indicators of availability and
performance. Custom metrics can provide insights into how availability
indicators impact user experience or the business. Collected data can be used to
alert of an outage or trigger scheduling decisions to scale up a deployment
automatically upon high demand.

To understand how metrics in OpenTelemetry works, let's look at a list of
components that will play a part in instrumenting our code.

## Meter Provider

A Meter Provider (sometimes called `MeterProvider`) is a factory for `Meter`s.
In most applications, a Meter Provider is initialized once and its lifecycle
matches the application's lifecycle. Meter Provider initialization also includes
Resource and Exporter initialization. It is typically the first step in metering
with OpenTelemetry. In some language SDKs, a global Meter Provider is already
initialized for you.

## Meter

A Meter creates _metric instruments_, capturing measurements about a service at
runtime. Meters are created from Meter Providers.

## Metric Exporter

Metric Exporters send metric data to a consumer. This consumer can be standard
output for debugging and development-time, the OpenTelemetry Collector, or any
open source or vendor backend of your choice.

## Metric Instruments

In OpenTelemetry measurements are captured by **metric instruments**. Such an
metric instrument is defined by a name, a kind, an optional unit and an optional
description. The name, unit and description of such an instrument is chosen by
the developer or defined via
[semantic conventions](/docs/specs/otel/metrics/semantic_conventions/) for
common ones like request or process metrics.

The instrument type is one of the following six:

- **Counter**: A value that accumulates over time -- you can think of this like
  an odometer on a car; it only ever goes up.
- **Asynchronous Counter**: Same as the **Counter**, but is collected once for
  each export. Could be used if you don't have access to the continuous
  increments, but only to the aggregated value.
- **UpDownCounter**: A value that accumulates over time, but can also go down
  again. An example could be a queue length, it will increase and decrease with
  the number of work items in the queue.
- **Asynchronous UpDownCounter**: Same as the **UpDownCounter**, but is
  collected once for each export. Could be used if you don't have access to the
  continuous changes, but only to the aggregated value (e.g., current queue
  size).
- **(Asynchronous) Gauge**: Measures a current value at the time it is read. An
  example would be the fuel gauge in a vehicle. Gauges are _always_
  asynchronous.
- **Histogram**: A histogram is a client-side aggregation of values, e.g.,
  request latencies. A histogram is likely a good choice if you have a lot of
  values, and are not interested in every individual value, but a statistic
  about these values (e.g., How many requests take fewer than 1s?)

## Aggregation

In addition to the metric instruments, the concept of **aggregations** is an
important one to understand. An aggregation is a technique whereby a large
number of measurements are combined into either exact or estimated statistics
about metric events that took place during a time window. The OTLP protocol
transports such aggregated metrics. The OpenTelemetry API provides a default
aggregation for each instrument which can be overridden using the Views. The
OpenTelemetry project aims to provide default aggregations that are supported by
visualizers and telemetry backends.

Unlike [request tracing](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/), which is intended to
capture request lifecycles and provide context to the individual pieces of a
request, metrics are intended to provide statistical information in aggregate.
Some examples of use cases for metrics include:

- Reporting the total number of bytes read by a service, per protocol type.
- Reporting the total number of bytes read and the bytes per request.
- Reporting the duration of a system call.
- Reporting request sizes in order to determine a trend.
- Reporting CPU or memory usage of a process.
- Reporting average balance values from an account.
- Reporting current active requests being handled.

## Views

A View provides SDK users with the flexibility to customize the metrics that are
output by the SDK. They can customize which metric instruments are to be
processed or ignored. They can customize aggregation and what attributes are to
be reported on metrics.

## Language Support

Metrics are a [stable](/docs/specs/otel/versioning-and-stability/#stable) signal
in the OpenTelemetry specification. For the individual language specific
implementations of the Metrics API & SDK, the status is as follows:
