 Before digging into OpenTelemetry, it is important to understand some core concepts first.

## What is Observability?

Observability lets us understand a system from the outside, by letting us ask
questions about that system without knowing its inner workings. Furthermore,
allows us to easily troubleshoot and handle novel problems (i.e. "unknown
unknowns”), and helps us answer the question, "Why is this happening?"

In order to be able to ask those questions of a system, the application must be
properly instrumented. That is, the application code must emit
[signals](/docs/concepts/signals/) such as
[traces](/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces),
[metrics](/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#reliability--metrics), and
[logs](/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#logs). An application is properly
instrumented when developers don't need to add more instrumentation to
troubleshoot an issue, because they have all of the information they need.

[**OpenTelemetry**](/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry) is the mechanism by
which application code is instrumented, to help make a system observable.

## Reliability & Metrics

**Telemetry** refers to data emitted from a system, about its behavior. The
data can come in the form of [Traces](#distributed-traces),
[Metrics](#reliability--metrics), and [Logs](#logs).

**Reliability** answers the question: "Is the service doing what users expect it
to be doing?” A system could be up 100% of the time, but if, when a user clicks
"Add to Cart” to add a black pair of pants to their shopping cart, and instead,
the system keeps adding a red pair of pants, then the system would be said to be
**un**reliable.

**Metrics** are aggregations over a period of time of numeric data about your
infrastructure or application. Examples include: system error rate, CPU
utilization, request rate for a given service.

**SLI**, or Service Level Indicator, represents a measurement of a service's
behavior. A good SLI measures your service from the perspective of your users.
An example SLI can be the speed at which a web page loads.

**SLO**, or Service Level Objective, is the means by which reliability is
communicated to an organization/other teams. This is accomplished by attaching
one or more SLIs to business value.

## Understanding Distributed Tracing

To understand Distributed Tracing, let's start with some basics.

### Logs

A **Log** is a timestamped message emitted by services or other components.
Unlike [Traces](#distributed-traces), however, they are not necessarily
associated with any particular user request or transaction. They are found
almost everywhere in software, and have been heavily relied on in the past by
both developers and operators alike to help them understand system behavior.

Sample Log:

```text
I, [2021-02-23T13:26:23.505892 #22473]  INFO -- : [6459ffe1-ea53-4044-aaa3-bf902868f730] Started GET "/" for ::1 at 2021-02-23 13:26:23 -0800
```

Unfortunately, logs aren't extremely useful for tracking code execution, as they
typically lack contextual information, such as where they were called from.

They become far more useful when they are included as part of a [Span](#spans).

### Spans

A **Span** represents a unit of work or operation. It tracks specific operations
that a request makes, painting a picture of what happened during the time in
which that operation was executed.

A Span contains name, time-related data,
[structured log messages](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#span-events), and
[other metadata (i.e. Attributes)](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#attributes) to
provide information about the operation it tracks.

Below is a sample of the type of information that would be present in a Span:

### Distributed Traces

A **Distributed Trace**, more commonly known as a **Trace**, records the paths
taken by requests (made by an application or end-user) as they propagate
through multi-service architectures, like microservice and serverless
applications.

Without tracing, it is challenging to pinpoint the cause of performance problems
in a distributed system.

It improves the visibility of our application or system's health and lets us
debug behavior that is difficult to reproduce locally. Tracing is essential for
distributed systems, which commonly have nondeterministic problems or are too
complicated to reproduce locally.

Tracing makes debugging and understanding distributed systems less daunting by
breaking down what happens within a request as it flows through a distributed
system.

A Trace is made of one or more Spans. The first Span represents the Root Span.
Each Root Span represents a request from start to finish. The Spans underneath
the parent provide a more in-depth context of what occurs during a request (or
what steps make up a request).

Many Observability back-ends visualize Traces as waterfall diagrams that may
look something like this:

![Sample Trace](/img/waterfall_trace.png "trace waterfall diagram")

Waterfall diagrams show the parent-child relationship between a Root Span and
its child Spans. When a Span encapsulates another Span, this also represents a
nested relationship.
