  How OpenTelemetry facilitates automatic and manual instrumentation of applications
weight: 40

In order to make a system observable, it must be instrumented. That is, the code
must emit [traces](/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces),
[metrics](/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#reliability--metrics), and
[logs](/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#logs). OpenTelemetry facilitates
the instrumenting of applications, by providing means to automatically or
manually instrument your application.

The exact installation mechanism for OpenTelemetry varies based on the language
youâ€™re developing in, but there are some similarities covered in the sections
 below.

## Automatic Instrumentation

### Add dependencies

In order to enable automatic instrumentation, one or more dependencies need to
be added. How dependencies are added are language specific. At a minimum, these
dependencies will add OpenTelemetry API and SDK capabilities. Some languages
also require per instrumentation dependencies. Exporter dependencies may also be
required. For more information about the OpenTelemetry API and SDK, see the
[specification](/docs/reference/specification/).

### Configure OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

Configuration is available via environment variables and possibly language
specific means such as system properties in Java. At a minimum, a service name
must be configured to identify the service being instrumented. A variety of
other configuration options are available and may include:

- Data source specific configuration
- Exporter configuration
- Propagator configuration
- Resource configuration

## Manual Instrumentation

### Import the OpenTelemetry API and SDK

You'll first need to import OpenTelemetry to your service code. If you're
developing a library or some other component that is intended to be consumed by
a runnable binary, then you would only take a dependency on the API. If your
artifact is a standalone process or service, then you would take a dependency on
the API and the SDK. For more information about the OpenTelemetry API and SDK,
see the [specification](/docs/reference/specification/).

### Configure the OpenTelemetry API

In order to create traces or metrics, you'll need to first create a tracer
and/or meter provider. In general, we recommend that the SDK should provide a
single default provider for these objects. You'll then get a tracer or meter
instance from that provider, and give it a name and version. The name you choose
here should identify what exactly is being instrumented -- if you're writing a
library, for example, then you should name it after your library (i.e.,
`com.legitimatebusiness.myLibrary` or some other unique identifier) as this name
will namespace all spans or metric events produced. It is also recommended that
you supply a version string (i.e., `semver:1.0.0`) that corresponds to the
current version of your library or service.

### Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK

If you're building a service process, you'll also need to configure the SDK with
appropriate options for exporting your telemetry data to some analysis backend.
We recommend that this configuration be handled programmatically through a
configuration file or some other mechanism. There are also per-language tuning
options you may wish to take advantage of.

### Create Telemetry Data

Once you've configured the API and SDK, you'll then be free to create traces and
metric events through the tracer and meter objects you obtained from the
provider. You can also utilize a plugin or integration to create traces and
metric events for you -- check out the [registry](/registry) or your language's
repository for more information on these.

### Export Data

Once you've created telemetry data, you'll want to send it somewhere.
OpenTelemetry supports two primary methods of exporting data from your process
to an analysis backend, either directly from a process or by proxying it through
the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/collector).

In-process export requires you to import and take a dependency on one or more
_exporters_, libraries that translate OpenTelemetry's in-memory span and metric
objects into the appropriate format for telemetry analysis tools like Jaeger or
Prometheus. In addition, OpenTelemetry supports a wire protocol known as `OTLP`,
which is supported by all OpenTelemetry SDKs. This protocol can be used to send
data to the OpenTelemetry Collector, a standalone binary process that can be run
as a proxy or sidecar to your service instances or run on a separate host. The
Collector can then be configured to forward and export this data to your choice
of analysis tools.

In addition to open source tools such as Jaeger or Prometheus, a growing list of
companies support ingesting telemetry data from OpenTelemetry. Please see
[this page](/vendors) for more details.
