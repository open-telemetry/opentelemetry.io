Welcome to the OpenTelemetry for Erlang/Elixir getting started guide! This guide
will walk you through the basic steps in installing, configuring, and exporting data
from OpenTelemetry.

## Installation

OpenTelemetry packages for Erlang/Elixir are available on
[hex.pm](https://hex.pm). There are two packages you might want to install,
depending on what you are trying to accomplish.

### `opentelemetry_api`

If you are developing a library or OTP Application that someone else would include
into their deployed code and you want to provide OpenTelemetry instrumentation
for them, you'll want to add the dependency `opentelemetry_api`. This package contains
only the API of OpenTelemetry. It will not start any processes and all API calls
(such as starting a span) will be a no-op that creates no data, unless the
`opentelemetry` SDK package is also installed.

### `opentelemetry`

If you are developing an Application that will actually be deployed and export
OpenTelemetry data, whether from instrumented dependencies or your code itself,
you'll want to add the `opentelemetry` package. This is the implementation of the
API and will start a Supervision tree, handling the necessary components for recording
and exporting OpenTelemetry signals. This is the package where you would configure
the destination(s) for your OpenTelemetry data, whether it be to an OpenTelemetry
Collector instance, or directly to a vendor's data ingestion API.

To get started with this guide, create a new project with `rebar3` or `mix`:

{{< tabs Erlang Elixir >}}

{{< tab >}}
$ rebar3 new release otel_getting_started
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
$ mix new --sup otel_getting_started
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}


Then, in the project you just created, add both `opentelemetry_api` and
`opentelemetry` as dependencies. We add both because this is a project we will
run as a Release and export spans from.

{{< tabs Erlang Elixir >}}

{{< tab >}}
{deps, [{opentelemetry_api, "~> 1.0.0-rc.1"}, 
        {opentelemetry, "~> 1.0.0-rc.1"}]}.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
def deps do
  [
    {:opentelemetry_api, "~> 1.0.0-rc.1"},
    {:opentelemetry, "~> 1.0.0-rc.1"}
  ]
end
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

In the case of Erlang, the Applications will also need to be added to
`src/otel_getting_started.app.src`. In an Elixir project, a `releases`
section needs to be added to `mix.exs`: 

{{< tabs Erlang Elixir >}}

{{< tab >}}
...
{applications, [kernel,
                stdlib,
                opentelemetry_api,
                opentelemetry]},
...
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
releases: [
  otel_getting_started: [
    version: "0.0.1",
    applications: [otel_getting_started: :permanent]
  ]
]
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Initialization and Configuration

Configuration is done through the [Application
environment](https://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html#configuring-an-application)
or [OS Environment
Variables](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md). The
`opentelemetry` Application uses the configuration to initialize a [Tracer
Provider](https://hexdocs.pm/opentelemetry_api/otel_tracer_provider.html), its
[Span Processors](https://hexdocs.pm/opentelemetry/otel_span_processor.html) and
the [Exporter](https://hexdocs.pm/opentelemetry/otel_exporter.html).

### Using the Console Exporter

Exporters are packages that allow telemetry data to be emitted somewhere -
either to the console (which is what we're doing here), or to a remote system or
collector for further analysis and/or enrichment. OpenTelemetry supports a
variety of exporters through its ecosystem, including popular open-source tools
like Jaeger and Zipkin.

To configure OpenTelemetry to use a particular exporter, in this case
`otel_exporter_stdout`, the Application environment for `opentelemetry` must
set the `exporter` for the span processor `otel_batch_processor`, a type
of span processor that batches up multiple spans over a period of time:

{{< tabs Erlang Elixir >}}

{{< tab >}}
%% config/sys.config.src
[
 {opentelemetry,
  [{processors, [{otel_batch_processor,
                  #{exporter => {otel_exporter_stdout, []}}
                 }]
   }]}
].
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
## config/runtime.exs
config :opentelemetry, :processors,
  otel_batch_processor: %{
    exporter: {:otel_exporter_stdout, []}
  }
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

## Working with Spans

Now that the dependencies and configuration are set up, we can create a module with
a function `hello/0` that starts some spans:

{{< tabs Erlang Elixir >}}

{{< tab >}}
%% apps/otel_getting_started/src/otel_getting_started.erl
-module(otel_getting_started).

-export([hello/0]).

-include_lib("opentelemetry_api/include/otel_tracer.hrl").

hello() ->
    %% start an active span and run a local function
    ?with_span(<<"operation">>, #{}, fun nice_operation/1).

nice_operation(_SpanCtx) ->
    ?add_event(<<"Nice operation!">>, [{<<"bogons">>, 100}]),
    ?set_attributes([{another_key, <<"yes">>}]),

    %% start an active span and run an anonymous function
    ?with_span(<<"Sub operation...">>, #{},
               fun(_ChildSpanCtx) ->
                       ?set_attributes([{lemons_key, <<"five">>}]),
                       ?add_event(<<"Sub span event!">>, [])
               end).
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab >}}
## lib/otel_getting_started.ex
defmodule OtelGettingStarted do
  require OpenTelemetry.Tracer, as: Tracer

  def hello do
    Tracer.with_span "operation" do
      Tracer.add_event("Nice operation!", [{"bogons", 100}])
      Tracer.set_attributes([{:another_key, "yes"}])

      Tracer.with_span "Sub operation..." do
        Tracer.set_attributes([{:lemons_key, "five"}])
        Tracer.add_event("Sub span event!", [])
      end
    end
  end
end
{{< /tab >}}

In this example, we're using macros that use the process dictionary for
context propagation and for getting the tracer.

Inside our function, we're creating a new span named `operation` with the
`with_span` macro. The macro sets the new span as `active` in the current
context -- stored in the process dictionary, since we aren't passing a
context as a variable. 

Spans can have attributes and events, which are metadata and log statements that
help you interpret traces after-the-fact. The first span has an event `Nice
operation!`, with attributes on the event, as well as an attribute set on the
span itself. 

Finally, in this code snippet, we can see an example of creating a child span of
the currently-active span. When the `with_span` macro starts a new span, it uses
the active span of the current context as the parent. So when you run this program,
you'll see that the `Sub operation...` span has been created as a child of the
`operation` span.

To test out this project and see the spans created, you can run with `rebar3
shell` or `iex -S mix`, each will pick up the corresponding configuration for
the release, resulting in the tracer and exporter to started.
