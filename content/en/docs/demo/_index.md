## Scenarios

How can you solve problems with OpenTelemetry? These scenarios walk you through
some pre-configured problems and show you how to interpret OpenTelemetry data to
solve them.

We'll be adding more scenarios over time.

- Generate a [Product Catalog error](feature-flags) for `GetProduct` requests
  with product id: `OLJCESPC7Z` using the Feature Flag service
- Discover a memory leak and diagnose it using metrics and traces. [Read more](scenarios/recommendation-cache/)
