The demo provides several feature flags that you can use to simulate different
scenarios. These flags are managed by [`flagd`](https://flagd.dev), a simple
feature flag service that supports [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev). Flag
values are stored in the `src/flagd/demo.flagd.json` file. To enable a flag,
change the `defaultVariant` value in the config file for a given flag to "on".

| `adServiceHighCpu`                  | Ad Service       | Trigger high cpu load in the ad service. If you want to demo cpu throttling, set cpu resource limits      |
| `cartServiceFailure`                | Cart Service     | Generate an error for `EmptyCart` 1/10th of the time                                                      |

## Feature Flag Architecture

Please see the [flagd documentation](https://flagd.dev) for more information on
how flagd works, and the [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev) website for more
information on how OpenFeature works, along with documentation for the
OpenFeature API.
