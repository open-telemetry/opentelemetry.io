title: OpenTelemetry Community Demo Requirements
linkTitle: Community Demo Requirements
---

The following documents capture the Application, OpenTelemetry (OTel), and System
requirements for our shared demo application. These were decided upon in the
ongoing SIG meeting.

1. [Application Requirements]({{% relref "./application_requirements.md" %}})

2. [OpenTelemetry Requirements]({{% relref "./opentelemetry_requirements.md" %}})

3. [System Requirements]({{% relref "./system_requirements.md" %}})

## Target Personas

We're building the demo application with several different target personas in mind:

1. **Enthusiasts** at a company that can use the demo app as an individual to
   advocate for OTel within their organization.

2. **Developers** with specific language skills who want to see a larger picture
   view.

3. **APM Vendors** who can evaluate OTel in general or need to produce a demo of
   their OTel capabilities for customers.

4. **Enterprises** considering adopting OTel and interested in understanding
   what a production-lite experience would be.
