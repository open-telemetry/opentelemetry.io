## Prerequisites

- Docker
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
  v2.0.0+
- 4 GB of RAM for the application

## Get and run the demo

1.  Clone the Demo repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo.git
    ```

2.  Change to the demo folder:

    ```shell
    cd opentelemetry-demo/
    ```

3.  Run docker compose[^1] to start the demo:

    ```shell
    docker compose up --no-build
    ```

    > **Notes:**
    >
    > - The `--no-build` flag is used to fetch released docker images from
    >   [ghcr](https://ghcr.io/open-telemetry/demo) instead of building from
    >   source. Removing the `--no-build` command line option will rebuild all
    >   images from source. It may take more than 20 minutes to build if the
    >   flag is omitted.
    > - If you're running on Apple Silicon, run `docker compose build`[^1] in
    >   order to create local images vs. pulling them from the repository.

## Verify the web store and Telemetry

Once the images are built and containers are started you can access:

- Web store: <http://localhost:8080/>
- Grafana: <http://localhost:8080/grafana/>
- Feature Flags UI: <http://localhost:8080/feature/>
- Load Generator UI: <http://localhost:8080/loadgen/>
- Jaeger UI: <http://localhost:8080/jaeger/ui/>

## Bring your own backend

Likely you want to use the web store as a demo application for an observability
backend you already have (e.g., an existing instance of Jaeger, Zipkin, or one
of the [vendor of your choice](/ecosystem/vendors/).

OpenTelemetry Collector can be used to export telemetry data to multiple
backends. By default, the collector in the demo application will merge the
configuration from two files:

- `otelcol-config.yml`
- `otelcol-config-extras.yml`

To add your backend, open the file
[src/otelcollector/otelcol-config-extras.yml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/src/otelcollector/otelcol-config-extras.yml)
with an editor.

- Start by adding a new exporter. For example, if your backend supports OTLP
  over HTTP, add the following:

  ```yaml
  exporters:
    otlphttp/example:
      endpoint: <your-endpoint-url>
  ```

- Then add a new pipeline with your new exporter:

  ```yaml
  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlphttp/example]
  ```

Vendor backends might require you to add additional parameters for
authentication, please check their documentation. Some backends require
different exporters, you may find them and their documentation available at
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib/exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter).

After updating the `otelcol-config-extras.yml`, start the demo by running
`docker compose up`[^1]. After a while, you should see the traces flowing into
your backend as well.
