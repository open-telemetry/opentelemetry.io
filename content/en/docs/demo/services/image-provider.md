This service provides the images which are used in the frontend. The images are
statically hosted on a NGINX instance. The NGINX server is instrumented with the
[nginx-otel module](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-otel/tree/main).

For details, see the
[image provider service source](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/src/image-provider/).
