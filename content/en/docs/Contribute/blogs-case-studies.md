The [OpenTelemetry blog](/blog/) communicates new features, community reports,
and any news that might be relevant to the OpenTelemetry community. This
includes end users and developers. Anyone can write a blog post and submit it
for review.

## Submit a post

Blog posts should not be commercial in nature and should consist of original
content that applies broadly to the OpenTelemetry community. Appropriate blog
content includes:

- New OpenTelemetry capabilities
- OpenTelemetry projects updates
- Updates from Special Interest Groups
- Tutorials and walkthroughs
- Thought leadership around OpenTelemetry
- OpenTelemetry Partner OSS integration

Unsuitable content includes:

- Vendor product pitches
- Partner updates without an integration and customer story

To submit a blog post, follow these steps:

1. [Sign the CLA](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors)
   if you have not yet done so.

1. Have a look at the Markdown format for existing blog posts in the
   [opentelemetry.io repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/content/en/blog).

1. Write out your blog post in a text editor of your choice.

1. On the same link from step 2, select **Create new file**. Paste your content into the editor.
   Name the file to match the proposed title of the blog post, but don’t put the date in the file name.
   The blog reviewers will work with you on the final file name and the date the blog will be published.

1. When you save the file, GitHub will walk you through the pull request process.

1. A blog post reviewer will review your submission and work with you on feedback and final details.
   When the blog post is approved, the blog will be scheduled for publication.

## Guidelines and expectations

- Blog posts should not be vendor pitches. 

  - Articles must contain content that applies broadly to the OpenTelemetry community. For example, a
    submission should focus on upstream OpenTelemetry as opposed to vendor-specific configurations.
    Check the [Documentation style guide](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/#what-s-allowed) for
    what is typically allowed on OpenTelemetry properties. 
  - Links should primarily be to the official OpenTelemetry documentation. When using external
    references, links should be diverse - For example a submission shouldn't contain only links
    back to a single company's blog.

- Blog posts are not published on specific dates.

  - Articles are reviewed by community volunteers. We'll try our best to accommodate specific
      timing, but we make no guarantees.
  - Many core parts of the OpenTelemetry projects submit blog posts during release windows, delaying
    publication times. Consider submitting during a quieter period of the release cycle.
  - If you are looking for greater coordination on post release dates, coordinating with
    [CNCF marketing](https://www.cncf.io/about/contact/) is a more appropriate choice than submitting a blog post.

- Blog posts should be relevant to OpenTelemetry users.

  - Topics related to participation in or results of OpenTelemetry SIGs activities are always on
    topic.
  - Posts about other CNCF projects may or may not be on topic. We recommend asking the blog team
    before submitting a draft.
  - Many CNCF projects have their own blog. These are often a better choice for posts. There are
    times of major feature or milestone for a CNCF project that users would be interested in
    reading on the OpenTelemetry blog.
