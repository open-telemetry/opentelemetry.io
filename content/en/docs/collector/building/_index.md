You can configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with components from the
[community](/docs/collector/components/) and
[broader ecosystem](/ecosystem/registry/), and you can
also develop and build on your own custom components. This section describes how
to build some of those components. For additional details, see the documentation
in the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/README.md).
