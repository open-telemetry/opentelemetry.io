The OpenTelemetry Collector can be extended not only by existing components, but
also by custom components that you develop and build on your own. Here you can
find instructions on how to build some of those components. For additional
details, review the documents in the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/README.md).
