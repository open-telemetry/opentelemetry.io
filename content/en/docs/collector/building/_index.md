The OpenTelemetry Collector can not only be extended via existing components, but
also via custom components that you develop and build on your own. Here you will
find instructions on how to build some of those components. For additional
details, refer to the documents in the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/README.md).
