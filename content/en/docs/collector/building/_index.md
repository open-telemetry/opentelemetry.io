The OpenTelemetry Collector can not only be extended by existing components, but
also by custom components, that you develop and build on your own. Here you will
find instructions on how to build some of those components. For additional
details take a look into the documents contained within the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/README.md).
