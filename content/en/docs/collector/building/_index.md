You can extend the OpenTelemetry Collector not only with existing components, but
also with custom components that you develop and build on your own. Here you find
instructions on how to build some of those components. For additional
details, take a look at the documents contained within the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/README.md).
