If you are planning to build and debug custom collector receivers, processors,
extensions, or exporters, you are going to need your own Collector instance.
That will allow you to launch and debug your OpenTelemetry Collector components
directly within your favorite Golang IDE.

The other interesting aspect of approaching the component development this way
is that you can use all the debugging features from your IDE (stack traces are
great teachers!) to understand how the Collector itself interacts with your
component code.

The OpenTelemetry Community developed a tool called [OpenTelemetry Collector
builder][ocb] (or `ocb` for short) to assist people in assembling their own
distribution, making it easy to build a distribution that includes their custom
components along with components that are publicly available.

As part of the process the `ocb` will generate the Collector's source code,
which you can use to help build and debug your own custom components, so let's
get started.

## Step 1 - Install the builder

{{% alert color="primary" title="Note" %}}

The `ocb` tool requires Go to build the Collector distribution.
[Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your machine, if you haven't done so
already.

{{% /alert %}}

The `ocb` binary is available as a downloadable asset from OpenTelemetry
Collector [releases with `cmd/builder` tags][tags]. You will find a list of
assets named based on OS and chipset, so download the one that fits your
configuration:

{{% tab "Linux (AMD 64)" %}}

```sh

chmod +x ocb
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "Linux (ARM 64)" %}}

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fL -o ocb \

chmod +x ocb
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "Linux (ppc64le) "%}}

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fL -o ocb \
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/cmd%2Fbuilder%2F{{% version-from-registry collector-builder %}}/ocb_{{% version-from-registry collector-builder noPrefix %}}_linux_ppc64le
chmod +x ocb
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "macOS (AMD 64)" %}}

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fL -o ocb \
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/cmd%2Fbuilder%2F{{% version-from-registry collector-builder %}}/ocb_{{% version-from-registry collector-builder noPrefix %}}_darwin_amd64
chmod +x ocb
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "macOS (ARM 64)" %}}

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fL -o ocb \
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/cmd%2Fbuilder%2F{{% version-from-registry collector-builder %}}/ocb_{{% version-from-registry collector-builder noPrefix %}}_darwin_arm64
chmod +x ocb
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "Windows (AMD 64)" %}}

```sh
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/cmd%2Fbuilder%2F{{% version-from-registry collector-builder %}}/ocb_{{% version-from-registry collector-builder noPrefix %}}_windows_amd64.exe" -OutFile "ocb.exe"
Unblock-File -Path "ocb.exe"
```

{{% /tab %}} {{< /tabpane >}}

To make sure the `ocb` is ready to be used, go to your terminal and type
`./ocb help`, and once you hit enter you should have the output of the `help`
command showing up in your console.

## Step 2 - Create a builder manifest file

The builder's `manifest` file is a `yaml` where you pass information about the
code generation and compile process combined with the components that you would
like to add to your Collector's distribution.

The `manifest` starts with a map named `dist` which contains tags to help you
configure the code generation and compile process. In fact, all the tags for
`dist` are the equivalent of the `ocb` command line `flags`.

Here are the tags for the `dist` map:

| Tag          | Description                                                                                        | Optional | Default Value                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| module:      | The module name for the new distribution, following Go mod conventions. Optional, but recommended. | Yes      | `go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder`                                       |
| name:        | The binary name for your distribution                                                              | Yes      | `otelcol-custom`                                                                  |
| description: | A long name for the application.                                                                   | Yes      | `Custom OpenTelemetry Collector distribution`                                     |
| output_path: | The path to write the output (sources and binary).                                                 | Yes      | `/var/folders/86/s7l1czb16g124tng0d7wyrtw0000gn/T/otelcol-distribution3618633831` |
| version:     | The version for your custom OpenTelemetry Collector.                                               | Yes      | `1.0.0`                                                                           |
| go:          | Which Go binary to use to compile the generated sources.                                           | Yes      | go from the PATH                                                                  |

As you can see on the table above, all the `dist` tags are optional, so you will
be adding custom values for them depending if your intentions to make your
custom Collector distribution available for consumption by other users or if you
are simply leveraging the `ocb` to bootstrap your component development and
testing environment.

For this tutorial, you will be creating a Collector's distribution to support
the development and testing of components.

Go ahead and create a manifest file named `builder-config.yaml` with the
following content:

```yaml
dist:
  name: otelcol-dev
  description: Basic OTel Collector distribution for Developers
  output_path: ./otelcol-dev
```

Now you need to add the modules representing the components you want to be
incorporated in this custom Collector distribution. Take a look at the
[ocb configuration documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder#configuration)
to understand the different modules and how to add the components.

We will be adding the following components to our development and testing
collector distribution:

- Exporters: OTLP and Debug[^1]
- Receivers: OTLP
- Processors: Batch

The `builder-config.yaml` manifest file will look like this after adding the
components:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
dist:
  name: otelcol-dev
  description: Basic OTel Collector distribution for Developers
  output_path: ./otelcol-dev

exporters:
  - gomod:
      # NOTE: Prior to v0.86.0 use the `loggingexporter` instead of `debugexporter`.
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/debugexporter {{% version-from-registry collector-exporter-debug %}}
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlpexporter {{% version-from-registry collector-exporter-otlp %}}

processors:
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/batchprocessor {{% version-from-registry collector-processor-batch %}}

receivers:
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/receiver/otlpreceiver {{% version-from-registry collector-receiver-otlp %}}

providers:
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/envprovider v1.18.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/fileprovider v1.18.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/httpprovider v1.18.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/httpsprovider v1.18.0
  - gomod: go.opentelemetry.io/collector/confmap/provider/yamlprovider v1.18.0
```

{{% alert color="primary" title="Tip" %}}

For a list of components that you can add to your custom collector, see the
[OpenTelemetry Registry](/ecosystem/registry/?language=collector). Note that
registry entries provide the full name and version you need to add to your
`builder-config.yaml`.

{{% /alert %}}

## Step 3a - Generate the code and build your Collector's distribution

{{% alert color="primary" title="Note" %}}

This step is used to build your custom collector distribution using the `ocb`
binary. If you would like to build and deploy your custom Collector distribution
to a container orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes), skip this step and go to
[Step 3b](#step-3b---containerize-your-collectors-distribution).

{{% /alert %}}

All you need now is to let the `ocb` do its job, so go to your terminal and type
the following command:

```cmd
./ocb --config builder-config.yaml
```

If everything went well, here is what the output of the command should look
like:

```nocode
2022-06-13T14:25:03.037-0500	INFO	internal/command.go:85	OpenTelemetry Collector distribution builder	{"version": "{{% version-from-registry collector-builder noPrefix %}}", "date": "2023-01-03T15:05:37Z"}
2022-06-13T14:25:03.039-0500	INFO	internal/command.go:108	Using config file	{"path": "builder-config.yaml"}
2022-06-13T14:25:03.040-0500	INFO	builder/config.go:99	Using go	{"go-executable": "/usr/local/go/bin/go"}
2022-06-13T14:25:03.041-0500	INFO	builder/main.go:76	Sources created	{"path": "./otelcol-dev"}
2022-06-13T14:25:03.445-0500	INFO	builder/main.go:108	Getting go modules
2022-06-13T14:25:04.675-0500	INFO	builder/main.go:87	Compiling
2022-06-13T14:25:17.259-0500	INFO	builder/main.go:94	Compiled	{"binary": "./otelcol-dev/otelcol-dev"}
```

As defined in the `dist` section of your config file, you now have a folder
named `otelcol-dev` containing all the source code and the binary for your
Collector's distribution.

The folder structure should look like this:

```console
.
├── builder-config.yaml
├── ocb
└── otelcol-dev
    ├── components.go
    ├── components_test.go
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ├── main.go
    ├── main_others.go
    ├── main_windows.go
    └── otelcol-dev
```

You can now use the generated code to bootstrap your component development
projects and easily build and distribute your own collector distribution with
your components.

## Step 3b - Containerize your Collector's distribution

{{% alert color="primary" title="Note" %}}

This step will build your collector distribution inside a `Dockerfile`. Follow
this step if you need to deploy your Collector distribution to a container
orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes). If you would like to _only_ build your
collector distribution without containerization, go to
[Step 3a](#step-3a---generate-the-code-and-build-your-collectors-distribution).

{{% /alert %}}

You need to add two new files to your project:

- `Dockerfile` - Container image definition of your Collector distribution
- `collector-config.yaml` - Minimalist Collector configuration YAML for testing
  your distribution

After adding these files, your file structure looks like this:

```console
.
├── builder-config.yaml
├── collector-config.yaml
└── Dockerfile
```

The following `Dockerfile` builds your Collector distribution in-place, ensuring
that the resulting Collector distribution binary matches the target container
architecture (for example, `linux/arm64`, `linux/amd64`):

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```yaml
FROM alpine:3.19 AS certs
RUN apk --update add ca-certificates

FROM golang:1.23.6 AS build-stage
WORKDIR /build

COPY ./builder-config.yaml builder-config.yaml

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build GO111MODULE=on go install go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder@{{% version-from-registry collector-builder %}}
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build builder --config builder-config.yaml

FROM gcr.io/distroless/base:latest

ARG USER_UID=10001
USER ${USER_UID}

COPY ./collector-config.yaml /otelcol/collector-config.yaml
COPY --from=certs /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
COPY --chmod=755 --from=build-stage /build/otelcol-dev /otelcol

ENTRYPOINT ["/otelcol/otelcol-dev"]
CMD ["--config", "/otelcol/collector-config.yaml"]

EXPOSE 4317 4318 12001
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The following is the minimalist `collector-config.yaml` definition:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
```

Use the following commands to build a multi-architecture Docker image of the OCB
using `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` as the target build architectures. To
learn more, see this
[blog post](https://blog.jaimyn.dev/how-to-build-multi-architecture-docker-images-on-an-m1-mac/)
about multi-architecture builds.

```bash
# Enable Docker multi-arch builds
docker run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use

# Build the Docker image as Linux AMD and ARM,
# and loads the build result to "docker images"
docker buildx build --load \
  -t <collector_distribution_image_name>:<version> \
  --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .

# Test the newly-built image
docker run -it --rm -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 \
    --name otelcol <collector_distribution_image_name>:<version>
```
