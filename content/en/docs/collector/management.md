This document describes how you can manage your OpenTelemetry Collector
deployment at scale.

To get the most out of this page you should know how to install and configure
the collector. These topics are covered elsewhere:

- [Quick Start](/docs/collector/quick-start/) to understand how to install the
  OpenTelemetry Collector.
- [Configuration] for how to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector, setting up
  telemetry pipelines.

## Basics

Telemetry collection at scale requires a structured approach to manage agents.
Typical agent management tasks include:

1. Querying the agent information and configuration. The agent information can
   include its version, operating system related information, or capabilities.
   The configuration of the agent refers to its telemetry collection setup, for
   example, the OpenTelemetry Collector [configuration].
1. Upgrading/downgrading agents and management of agent-specific packages,
   including the base agent functionality and plugins.
1. Applying new configurations to agents. This might be required because of
   changes in the environment or due to policy changes.
1. Health and performance monitoring of the agents, typically CPU and memory
   usage and also agent-specific metrics, for example, the rate of processing or
   backpressure-related information.
1. Connection management between a control plane and the agent such as handling
   of TLS certificates (revocation and rotation).

Not every use case requires support for all of the above agent management tasks.
In the context of OpenTelemetry task _4. Health and performance monitoring_ is
ideally done using OpenTelemetry.

## OpAMP

Observability vendors and cloud providers offer proprietary solutions for agent
management. In the open source observability space, there is an emerging
standard that you can use for agent management: [Open Agent Management Protocol]
(OpAMP).

The [OpAMP specification] defines how to manage a fleet of telemetry data
agents. These agents can be [OpenTelemetry Collectors](/docs/collector/), Fluent
Bit or other agents in any arbitrary combination.

> **Note** The term "agent" is used here as a catch-all term for OpenTelemetry
> components that respond to OpAMP, this could be the collector but also SDK
> components.

OpAMP is a client/server protocol that supports communication over HTTP and over
WebSockets:

- The **OpAMP server** is part of the control plane and acts as the
  orchestrator, managing a fleet of telemetry agents.
- The **OpAMP client** is part of the data plane. The client side of OpAMP can
  be implemented in-process, for example, as the case in [OpAMP support in the
  OpenTelemetry Collector][opamp-in-otel-collector]. The client side of OpAMP
  could alternatively be implemented out-of-process. For this latter option, you
  can use a supervisor that takes care of the OpAMP specific communication with
  the OpAMP server and at the same time controls the telemetry agent, for
  example to apply a configuration or to upgrade it. Note that the
  supervisor/telemetry communication is not part of OpAMP.

Let's have a look at a concrete setup:

![OpAMP example setup](../img/opamp.svg)

1. The OpenTelemetry Collector, configured with pipeline(s) to:
   - (A) receive signals from downstream sources
   - (B) export signals to upstream destinations, potentially including
     telemetry about the collector itself (represented by the OpAMP `own_xxx`
     connection settings).
1. The bi-directional OpAMP control flow between the control plane implementing
   the server-side OpAMP part and the collector (or a supervisor controlling the
   collector) implementing OpAMP client-side.

### Try it out

You can try out a simple OpAMP setup yourself by using the [OpAMP protocol
implementation in Go][opamp-go]. For the following walkthrough you will need Go
1.22+.

We will set up a simple OpAMP control plane consisting of an example OpAMP
server and let an OpenTelemetry Collector connect to it using the [OpAMP
Supervisor][opamp-supervisor].

#### Step 1 - Start the OpAMP server

Clone the `open-telemetry/opamp-go` repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-go.git
```

In the `./opamp-go/internal/examples/server` directory, launch the OpAMP server:

```console
$ go run .
2025/04/20 15:10:35.307207 [MAIN] OpAMP Server starting...
2025/04/20 15:10:35.308201 [MAIN] OpAMP Server running...
```

#### Step 2 - Install the OpenTelemetry Collector

We need an OpenTelemetry Collector binary that the OpAMP Supervisor can manage.
For that, install the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib][otelcolcontrib] distro.
The path where you installed the Collector binary is referred to as
`$OTEL_COLLECTOR_BINARY` in the following configuration.

#### Step 3 - Install the OpAMP Supervisor

The `opampsupervisor` binary is available as a downloadable asset from
OpenTelemetry Collector [releases with `cmd/opampsupervisor` tags][tags]. You
will find a list of assets named based on OS and chipset, so download the one
that fits your configuration:

chmod +x opampsupervisor
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "Windows (AMD 64)" %}}

```sh

Unblock-File -Path "opampsupervisor.exe"
```

{{% /tab %}} {{< /tabpane >}}

#### Step 4 - Create an OpAMP Supervisor configuration file

Create a file named `supervisor.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
server:
  endpoint: wss://127.0.0.1:4320/v1/opamp
  tls:
    insecure_skip_verify: true

capabilities:
  accepts_remote_config: true
  reports_effective_config: true
  reports_own_metrics: false
  reports_own_logs: true
  reports_own_traces: false
  reports_health: true
  reports_remote_config: true

agent:
  executable: $OTEL_COLLECTOR_BINARY

storage:
  directory: ./storage
```

{{% alert color="primary" title="NOTE" %}}

Make sure to replace `$OTEL_COLLECTOR_BINARY` with the actual file path. For
example, in Linux or macOS, if you installed the Collector in `/usr/local/bin/`,
then you would replace `$OTEL_COLLECTOR_BINARY` with `/usr/local/bin/otelcol`.

{{% /alert %}}

#### Step 5 - Run the OpAMP Supervisor

Now it's time to launch the supervisor, which in turn launches your
OpenTelemetry Collector:

```console
$ ./opampsupervisor --config=./supervisor.yaml
{"level":"info","ts":1745154644.746028,"logger":"supervisor","caller":"supervisor/supervisor.go:340","msg":"Supervisor starting","id":"01965352-9958-72da-905c-e40329c32c64"}
{"level":"info","ts":1745154644.74608,"logger":"supervisor","caller":"supervisor/supervisor.go:1086","msg":"No last received remote config found"}
```

If everything worked out, you should now be able to go to
[http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/) and access the OpAMP server UI.
You should see your Collector listed among the agents managed by the Supervisor:

![OpAMP example setup](../img/opamp-server-ui.png)

#### Step 6 - Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector remotely

Click on the Collector in the server UI and paste the following content to the
`Additional Configuration` box:

```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    scrapers:
      cpu:

exporters:
  # NOTE: Prior to v0.86.0 use `logging` instead of `debug`.
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      exporters: [debug]
```

Click `Save and Send to Agent`:

![OpAMP additional configuration](../img/opamp-server-additional-config.png)

Reload the page and verify that the Agent status shows `Up: true`:

![OpAMP agent](../img/opamp-server-agent.png)

You can query the Collector for the metrics exported (note the label values):

```console
$ curl localhost:8888/metrics
# HELP otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points Number of metric points in failed attempts to send to destination. [alpha]
# TYPE otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points counter
otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points{exporter="debug",service_instance_id="01965352-9958-72da-905c-e40329c32c64",service_name="otelcol-contrib",service_version="0.124.1"} 0
# HELP otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points Number of metric points successfully sent to destination. [alpha]
# TYPE otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points counter
otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points{exporter="debug",service_instance_id="01965352-9958-72da-905c-e40329c32c64",service_name="otelcol-contrib",service_version="0.124.1"} 132
# HELP otelcol_process_cpu_seconds Total CPU user and system time in seconds [alpha]
# TYPE otelcol_process_cpu_seconds counter
otelcol_process_cpu_seconds{service_instance_id="01965352-9958-72da-905c-e40329c32c64",service_name="otelcol-contrib",service_version="0.124.1"} 0.127965
...
```

You can also inspect the Collector's logs:

```console
$ cat ./storage/agent.log
