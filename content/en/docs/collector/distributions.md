## Custom Distributions

For various reasons the existing distributions provided by the OpenTelemetry
project may not meet your needs. Whether you want a smaller version, or have the
need to implement custom functionality like
[authenticator extensions](../building/authenticator-extension),
[receivers](../building/receiver), processors, exporters or
[connectors](../building/connector). The tool used to build distributions
[ocb](../custom-collector) (OpenTelemetry Collector Builder) is available to
build your own distributions.
