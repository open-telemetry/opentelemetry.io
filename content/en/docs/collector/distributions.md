## Custom Distributions

Existing distributions provided by the OpenTelemetry project may not meet your
needs. For example, you may want a smaller binary or need to implement custom
functionality like
[authenticator extensions](../building/authenticator-extension),
[receivers](../building/receiver), processors, exporters or
[connectors](../building/connector). The tool used to build distributions
[ocb](../custom-collector) (OpenTelemetry Collector Builder) is available to
build your own distributions.
