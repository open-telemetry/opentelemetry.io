You can configure the OpenTelemetry Collector with components from the
[community](/docs/collector/components/) and
[broader ecosystem](/ecosystem/registry/), and you can also develop and build on
your own custom components. This section describes how to build some of those
components. For additional details, see the documentation in the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/README.md).
