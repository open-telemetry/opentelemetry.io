You can monitor the health of any OpenTelemetry Collector instance by checking
its own internal telemetry. Read on to learn about this telemetry and how to
configure it to help you [troubleshoot](/docs/collector/troubleshooting/)
Collector issues.

## Activate internal telemetry in the Collector

By default, the Collector exposes its own telemetry in two ways:

- Internal [metrics](#configure-internal-metrics) are exposed using a Prometheus
  interface which defaults to port `8888`.
- [Logs](#configure-internal-logs) are emitted to `stderr` by default.

### Configure internal metrics

You can configure how internal metrics are generated and exposed by the
Collector. By default, the Collector generates basic metrics about itself and
exposes them for scraping at `http://127.0.0.1:8888/metrics`. You can expose the
endpoint to one specific or all network interfaces when needed. For
containerized environments, you might want to expose this port on a public
interface.

Set the address in the config `service::telemetry::metrics`:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      address: 0.0.0.0:8888
```

You can adjust the verbosity of the Collector metrics output by setting the
`level` field to one of the following values:

- `none`: no telemetry is collected.
- `basic`: essential service telemetry.
- `normal`: the default level, adds standard indicators on top of basic.
- `detailed`: the most verbose level, includes dimensions and views.

Each verbosity level represents a threshold at which certain metrics are
emitted. For the complete list of metrics, with a breakdown by level, see
[Lists of internal metrics](#lists-of-internal-metrics).

The default level for metrics output is `normal`. To use another level, set
`service::telemetry::metrics::level`:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      level: detailed
```

The Collector can also be configured to scrape its own metrics using a
[Prometheus receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver)
and send them through configured pipelines. For example:

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'otelcol'
          scrape_interval: 10s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['0.0.0.0:8888']
          metric_relabel_configs:
            - source_labels: [__name__]
              regex: '.*grpc_io.*'
              action: drop
exporters:
  debug:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      exporters: [debug]
```

When self-monitoring, the Collector collects its own telemetry and sends it to
the desired backend for analysis. This can be a risky practice. If the Collector
is underperforming, its self-monitoring capability could be impacted. As a
result, the self-monitored telemetry might not reach the backend in time for
critical analysis.

### Configure internal logs

Log output is found in `stderr`. You can configure logs in the config
`service::telemetry::logs`. The [configuration
options](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/v{{%
param vers %}}/service/telemetry/config.go) are:

| `disable_caller`       | `false`       | Stops annotating logs with the calling function's file name and line number. By default, all logs are annotated.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `disable_stacktrace`   | `false`       | Disables automatic stacktrace capturing. Stacktraces are captured for logs at `WARN` level and above in development and at `ERROR` level and above in production.                                                                                                                                 |
| `sampling::enabled`    | `true`        | Sets a sampling policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `sampling::tick`       | `10s`         | The interval in seconds that the logger applies to each sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `sampling::thereafter` | `100`         | Sets the sampling policy for subsequent messages after `sampling::initial` messages are logged. When `sampling::thereafter` is set to `N`, every `Nth` message is logged and all others are dropped. If `N` is zero, the logger drops all messages after `sampling::initial` messages are logged. |
| `output_paths`         | `["stderr"]`  | A list of URLs or file paths to write logging output to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `initial_fields`       |               | A collection of static key-value pairs added to all log entries to enrich logging context. By default, there is no initial field.                                                                                                                                                                 |

You can also see logs for the Collector on a Linux systemd system using
`journalctl`:

{{< tabpane text=true >}} {{% tab "All logs" %}}

```sh
journalctl | grep otelcol
```

{{% /tab %}} {{% tab "Errors only" %}}

```sh
journalctl | grep otelcol | grep Error
```

{{% /tab %}} {{< /tabpane >}}

## Types of internal observability

The OpenTelemetry Collector aims to be a model of observable service by clearly
exposing its own operational metrics. Additionally, it collects host resource
metrics that can help you understand if problems are caused by a different
process on the same host. Specific components of the Collector can also emit
their own custom telemetry. In this section, you will learn about the different
types of observability emitted by the Collector itself.

### Values observable with internal metrics

The Collector emits internal metrics for the following **current values**:

- Resource consumption, including CPU, memory, and I/O.
- Data reception rate, broken down by receiver.
- Data export rate, broken down by exporters.
- Data drop rate due to throttling, broken down by data type.
- Data drop rate due to invalid data received, broken down by data type.
- Throttling state, including Not Throttled, Throttled by Downstream, and
  Internally Saturated.
- Incoming connection count, broken down by receiver.
- Incoming connection rate showing new connections per second, broken down by
  receiver.
- In-memory queue size in bytes and in units.
- Persistent queue size.
- End-to-end latency from receiver input to exporter output.
- Latency broken down by pipeline elements, including exporter network roundtrip
  latency for request/response protocols.

Rate values are averages over 10 second periods, measured in bytes/sec or
units/sec (for example, spans/sec).

{{% alert title="Caution" color="warning" %}}

Byte measurements can be expensive to compute.

{{% /alert %}}

The Collector also emits internal metrics for these **cumulative values**:

- Total received data, broken down by receivers.
- Total exported data, broken down by exporters.
- Total dropped data due to throttling, broken down by data type.
- Total dropped data due to invalid data received, broken down by data type.
- Total incoming connection count, broken down by receiver.
- Uptime since start.

### Lists of internal metrics

The following tables group each internal metric by level of verbosity: `basic`,
`normal`, and `detailed`. Each metric is identified by name and description and
categorized by instrumentation type.

<!---To compile this list, configure a Collector instance to emit its own metrics to the localhost:8888/metrics endpoint. Select a metric and grep for it in the Collector core repository. For example, the `otelcol_process_memory_rss` can be found using:`grep -Hrn "memory_rss" .` Make sure to eliminate from your search string any words that might be prefixes. Look through the results until you find the .go file that contains the list of metrics. In the case of `otelcol_process_memory_rss`, it and other process metrics can be found in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/31528ce81d44e9265e1a3bbbd27dc86d09ba1354/service/internal/proctelemetry/process_telemetry.go#L92. Note that the Collector's internal metrics are defined in several different files in the repository.--->

### Events observable with internal logs

The Collector logs the following internal events:

- A Collector instance starts or stops.
- Data dropping begins due to throttling for a specified reason, such as local
  saturation, downstream saturation, downstream unavailable, etc.
- Data dropping due to throttling stops.
- Data dropping begins due to invalid data. A sample of the invalid data is
  included.
- Data dropping due to invalid data stops.
- A crash is detected, differentiated from a clean stop. Crash data is included
  if available.
