  Why and how to send signals to a single OTLP end-point and from there to

The gateway collector deployment pattern consists of applications (or other
collectors) sending telemetry signals to a single OTLP endpoint provided by one
or more collector instances running as a standalone service (for example, a
deployment in Kubernetes), typically per cluster, per data center or per region.

In the general case you can use an out-of-the-box load balancer to distribute
the load amongst the collectors:

![Gateway deployment concept](../../img/otel_gateway_sdk.svg)

For use cases where the processing of the telemetry data processing has to
happen in a specific collector, you would use a two-tiered setup with a
collector that has a pipeline configured with the [Trace ID/Service-name aware
load-balancing exporter][lb-exporter] in the first tier and the collectors
handling the scale out in the second tier. For example, you will need to use the
load-balancing exporter when using the [Tail Sampling
processor][tailsample-processor] so that all spans for a given trace reach the
same collector instance where the tail sampling policy is applied.

Let's have a look at such a case where we are using the load-balancing exporter:

![Gateway deployment with load-balancing exporter](../../img/gateway-lb-sdk.svg)

1. In the app, the SDK is configured to send OTLP data to a central location.
2. A collector configured using the load-balancing exporter that distributes
   signals to a group of collectors.
3. The collectors are configured to send telemetry data to one or more backends.

## Examples

### NGINX as an "out-of-the-box" load balancer

Assuming you have three collectors (`collector1`, `collector2`, and
`collector3`) configured and you want to load balance traffic across them using
NGINX, you can use the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 4317 http2;
    server_name _;

    location / {
            grpc_pass      grpc://collector4317;
            grpc_next_upstream     error timeout invalid_header http_500;
            grpc_connect_timeout   2;
            grpc_set_header        Host            $host;
            grpc_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
            grpc_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen 4318;
    server_name _;

    location / {
            proxy_pass      http://collector4318;
            proxy_redirect  off;
            proxy_next_upstream     error timeout invalid_header http_500;
            proxy_connect_timeout   2;
            proxy_set_header        Host            $host;
            proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

upstream collector4317 {
    server collector1:4317;
    server collector2:4317;
}

upstream collector4318 {
    server collector1:4318;
    server collector2:4318;
}
```

### load-balancing exporter

For a concrete example of the centralized collector deployment pattern we first
need to have a closer look at the load-balancing exporter. It has two main
configuration fields:

- The `resolver`, which determines where to find the downstream collectors (or:
  backends). If you use the `static` sub-key here, you will have to manually
  enumerate the collector URLs. The other supported resolver is the DNS resolver
  which will periodically check for updates and resolve IP addresses. For this
  resolver type, the `hostname` sub-key specifies the hostname to query in order
  to obtain the list of IP addresses.
- With the `routing_key` field you tell the load-balancing exporter to route
  spans to specific downstream collectors. If you set this field to `traceID`
  (default) then the Load-balancing exporter exports spans based on their
  `traceID`. Otherwise, if you use `service` as the value for `routing_key`, it
  exports spans based on their service name which is useful when using
  connectors like the [Span Metrics connector][spanmetrics-connector], so all
  spans of a service will be send to the same downstream collector for metric
  collection, guaranteeing accurate aggregations.

The first-tier collector servicing the OTLP endpoint would be configured as
shown below:

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "DNS with service" >}}

  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:

  loadbalancing:
    routing_key: "service"
    protocol:
      otlp:
        insecure: true
    resolver:
      dns:
        hostname: collectors.example.com
        port: 5317

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [loadbalancing]
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane>}}

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The load-balancing exporter emits metrics including
`otelcol_loadbalancer_num_backends` and `otelcol_loadbalancer_backend_latency`
that you can use for health and performance monitoring of the OTLP endpoint
collector.

## Tradeoffs

Pros:

- Separation of concerns such as centrally managed credentials
- Centralized policy management (for example, filtering certain logs or
  sampling)

Cons:

- It's one more thing to maintain and that can fail (complexity)
- Added latency in case of cascaded collectors
- Higher overall resource usage (costs)
