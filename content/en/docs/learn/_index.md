This section of the OpenTelemetry documentation contains tutorials, that will
help you to cover the basics of Observability using OpenTelemetry and that will
teach you best practices for common advanced topics.

If you are new to OpenTelemetry, we recommend that you dive into the
[Getting Started](./getting-started/) first. By doing them, you will learn
hands-on about the main concepts, features and components of OpenTelemetry.

After completing the [Getting Started](./getting-started/), you can either dive
into the [Best Practices](./best-practices/), and learn more advanced topics
using hands on tutorials, or you can explore other sections of the
[OpenTelemetry Documentation](/docs) based on your needs and learning goals.
