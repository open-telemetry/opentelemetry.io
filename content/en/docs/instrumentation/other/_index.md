  Language-specific implementation of OpenTelemetry for other languages.
---

Implementing the OpenTelemetry specification is not limited to the languages you
will find in our documentation. OpenTelemetry is designed in a way that it is
possible to implement it in every language you like.

For some languages, unofficial implementations exist -- you can find them in the
[registry](/ecosystem/registry/). If you know about an implementation not listed
there, please [add it to the registry][].

The OpenTelemetry community is open to maintain implementations for additional
languages and with that make them "official" parts of the OpenTelemetry
projects. For that you can raise an issue and gauge interest in the formation of
a special interest group for your language.

For the following languages a request to create a SIG exists:

- [Lua](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1276)
- [Perl](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/828)
- [Julia](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/898)
