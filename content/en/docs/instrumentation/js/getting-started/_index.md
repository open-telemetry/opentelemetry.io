These two guides for Node.js and the browser use simple examples in javascript
to get you started with OpenTelemetry. Both will show you the following steps:

- Install the required OpenTelemetry libraries
- Initialize a global [tracer]({{< relref "/docs/reference/specification/trace/api#tracer" >}})
- Initialize and register a [span exporter]({{< relref "/docs/reference/specification/trace/sdk#span-exporter" >}})
