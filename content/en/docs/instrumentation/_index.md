OpenTelemetry code [instrumentation](/docs/concepts/instrumenting/) is supported for the languages listed below.
Depending on the language, topics covered will include some or all of the
following:

- Automatic instrumentation
- Manual instrumentation
- Exporting data

If you are using Kubernetes, you can use the [OpenTelemetry Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator) to [inject auto-instrumentation libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-injection) for Java, NodeJS and Python into your application.
