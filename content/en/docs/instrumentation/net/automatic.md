.NET supports automatic instrumentation with [instrumentation
libraries](/docs/reference/specification/glossary/#instrumentation-library) that
generate telemetry data for a particular instrumented library.

For example, the instrumentation library for ASP.NET Core will automatically
create [spans](/docs/concepts/otel-concepts#spans-in-opentelemetry) that track
inbound requests once you configure it in your app/service.

## Setup

Each instrumentation library is a NuGet package, and installing them is
typically done like so:

```
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.{library-name-or-type}
```

It is typically then registered at application startup time, such as when
creating a
[TracerProvider](/docs/concepts/otel-concepts#tracing-in-opentelemetry).

## Example with ASP.NET Core and HttpClient

As an example, here's how you can automatically instrument inbound and output
requests from an ASP.NET Core app.

First, get the appropriate packages:

```console
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http --prerelease
```

Next, configure each instrumentation library at startup and use them!

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

// Define some important constants and the activity source
var serviceName = "MyCompany.MyProduct.MyService";
var serviceVersion = "1.0.0";

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Configure important OpenTelemetry settings, the console exporter, and automatic instrumentation
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing(b =>
{
    b
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .AddSource(serviceName)
    .SetResourceBuilder(
        ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault()
            .AddService(serviceName: serviceName, serviceVersion: serviceVersion))
    .AddHttpClientInstrumentation()
    .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation();
});

var app = builder.Build();

var httpClient = new HttpClient();

app.MapGet("/hello", async () =>
{
    var html = await httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://example.com/");
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(html))
    {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
    else
    {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
});

app.Run();
```

When you run this code and access the `/hello` endpoint, it will:

* Start a new trace
* Automatically generate a span representing the request made to the endpoint
* Automatically generate a child span representing the HTTP GET made to
  `https://example.com/`

If you add more instrumentation libraries, then you can generate more data
automatically.

## Available instrumentation libraries

A full list of instrumentation libraries produced by OpenTelemetry is available
from the [opentelemetry-dotnet][] repository.

You can also find more instrumentations available in the
[registry](/registry/?language=dotnet&component=instrumentation).

## Next steps

After you have set up instrumentation libraries, you may want to add [manual
instrumentation](/docs/instrumentation/net/manual) to collect custom telemetry
data.

If you are using .NET Framework 4.x instead of modern .NET, refer to the [.NET
Framework docs](/docs/instrumentation/net/netframework) to configure
OpenTelemetry and instrumentation libraries on .NET Framework.

You'll also want to configure an appropriate exporter to [export your telemetry
data](/docs/instrumentation/net/exporters) to one or more telemetry backends.
