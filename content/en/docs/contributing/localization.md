The OTel website uses Hugo's [multilingual framework] to support page
localizations. English is the default language, with US English as the default
(implicit) localization. A growing number of other localizations are supported,
as can be seen from the languages dropdown menu in the top nav.

## Translation guidance

When translating website pages from English, we recommend that you follow the
guidance offered in this section.

### Summary

#### ✅ Do {#do}

<div class="border-start border-success bg-success-subtle">

- **Translate**:
  - Page content, including:
    - Mermaid [diagram](#images) text fields
    - Code comments from code excerpts
  - [Front matter][] field values for `title`, `linkTitle`, and `description`
  - **All** page content and front matter unless indicated otherwise
- **Preserve** the _content_, _meaning_, and _style_ of the original text
- **Ask** [maintainers] if you have any doubts or questions through:
  - [Slack] `#otel-docs-localization` or `#otel-comms` channels
  - [Discussion], issue, or PR comment

</div>

#### ❌ Do NOT {#do-not}

<div class="border-start border-warning bg-warning-subtle">

- **Translate**:
  - **File or directory** names of resources in this repository
  - [Links](#links), this includes [heading IDs](#headings).[^*]
  - [Front matter][] fields other than those listed in [Do](#do). In particular,
    do not translate `aliases`. When in doubt, ask maintainers.
  - Code
- Create **copies of images**, unless you [localize text in the images](#images)
- Add new or change:
  - **Content** that would be different from the originally intended meaning
  - Presentation **style**, including: _formatting_, _layout_, and _design_
    style (typography, letter case, and spacing for example).

[^*]: For a possible exception, see [Links](#links).

</div>

### Heading IDs {#headings}

To ensure that heading anchor targets are uniform across localizations, when
translating headings:

- Preserve the heading's explicit ID if it has one. [Heading ID syntax][] is
  written after the heading text using syntax like `{ #some-id }`.
- Otherwise, explicitly declare a heading ID corresponding to the autogenerated
  ID of the original English heading.

[Heading ID syntax]:
  https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/blob/master/README.md#headings

### Links {#links}

Do **not** translate link references. This holds true for external links, and
paths to website pages and section-local resources such as [images](#images).

The only exception is for links to external pages (such as
<https://en.wikipedia.org>) that have a version specific to your local. Often
this means replacing the `en` in the URL by your locale's language code.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}

The OTel website repository has a custom render-link hook that Hugo uses to
convert absolute link paths referring to documentation pages. **Links of the
form `/docs/some-page` are made locale specific** by prefixing the path with the
page language code when rendering the link. For example, the previous sample
path would become `/ja/docs/some-page` when rendered from a Japanese page.

{{% /alert %}}

### Images and diagrams {#images}

Do **not** make copies of image files unless you localize text in the image
itself[^shared-images].

**Do** translate text in [Mermaid][] diagrams.

[^shared-images]:
    Hugo is smart about the way that it renders image files that are shared
    across site localizations. That is, Hugo will output a _single_ image file
    and share it across locales.

[Mermaid]: https://mermaid.js.org

### Include files {#includes}

**Do** translate page fragments found under `_includes` directories just as you
would translate any other page content.

### Shortcodes

{{% alert title="Note" %}}

As of February 2025, we are in the process of migrating from shortcodes to
[include files](#includes) as a means of supporting shared-page content.

{{% /alert %}}

Some of the base shortcodes contain English text that you might need to localize
-- this is particularly true of those contained in [layouts/shortcodes/docs].

If you need to create a localized version of a shortcode, place it under
`layouts/shortcodes/xx`, where `xx` is your localization's language code. From
there, use the same relative path as the original base shortcode.

[layouts/shortcodes/docs]:
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/layouts/shortcodes/docs

## Keeping track of localized-page drift {#track-changes}

One of the main challenges of maintaining localized pages, is identifying when
the corresponding English language pages have been updated. This section
explains how we handle this.

### The `default_lang_commit` front-matter field

When a localized page is written, such as `content/zh/<some-path>/page.md`, this
translation is based on a specific [`main` branch commit][main] of the
corresponding English language version of the page at
`content/en/<some-path>/page.md`. In this repository, every localized page
identifies the English page commit in the localized page's front matter as
follows:

```markdown
---
title: Your localized page title
# ...
default_lang_commit: <most-recent-commit-hash-of-default-language-page>
---
```

The front matter above would be in `content/zh/<some-path>/page.md`. The commit
hash would correspond to the latest commit of `content/en/<some-path>/page.md`
from the `main` branch.

### Tracking changes to English pages

As updates are made to English language pages, you can keep track of the
corresponding localized pages that need updating by running the following
command:

```console
$ npm run check:i18n
1       1       content/en/docs/platforms/kubernetes/_index.md - content/zh/docs/platforms/kubernetes/_index.md
...
```

You can restrict the target pages to one or more localizations by providing
path(s) like this:

```sh
npm run check:i18n -- content/zh
```

### Viewing change details

For any given localized pages that need updating, you can see the diff details
of the corresponding English language pages by using the `-d` flag and providing
the paths to your localized pages, or omit the paths to see all. For example:

```console
$ npm run check:i18n -- -d content/zh/docs/platforms/kubernetes
diff --git a/content/en/docs/platforms/kubernetes/_index.md b/content/en/docs/platforms/kubernetes/_index.md
index 3592df5d..c7980653 100644
--- a/content/en/docs/platforms/kubernetes/_index.md

### Adding `default_lang_commit` to new pages

As you create pages for your localization, remember to add `default_lang_commit`
to the page front matter along with an appropriate commit hash from `main`.

If your page translation is based on an English page in `main` at `<hash>`, then
run the following command to automatically add `default_lang_commit` to your
page file's front matter using the commit `<hash>`. You can specify `HEAD` as an
argument if your pages are now synced with `main` at `HEAD`. For example:

```sh
npm run check:i18n -- -n -c 1ca30b4d content/ja
npm run check:i18n -- -n -c HEAD content/zh/docs/concepts
```

To list localization page files with missing hash keys, run:

```sh
npm run check:i18n -- -n
```

### Updating `default_lang_commit` for existing pages

As you update your localized pages to match changes made to the corresponding
English language page, ensure that you also update the `default_lang_commit`
commit hash.

{{% alert title="Tip" %}}

If your localized page now corresponds to the English language version in `main`
at `HEAD`, then erase the commit hash value in the front matter, and run the
**add** command given in the previous section to automatically refresh the
`default_lang_commit` field value.

{{% /alert %}}

If you have batch updated all of your localization pages that had drifted, you
can update the commit hash of these files using the `-c` flag followed by a
commit hash or 'HEAD' to use `main@HEAD`.

```sh
npm run check:i18n -- -c <hash> <PATH-TO-YOUR-NEW-FILES>
npm run check:i18n -- -c HEAD <PATH-TO-YOUR-NEW-FILES>
```

{{% alert title="Important" %}}

When you use `HEAD` as a hash specifier, the script will use the hash of `main`
at HEAD in your **local environment**. Make sure that you fetch and pull `main`,
if you want HEAD to correspond to `main` in GitHub.

{{% /alert %}}

### Drift status

Run `npm run fix:i18n:status` to add a front-matter field `drifted_from_default`
to those target localization pages that have drifted. This field will soon be
used to display a banner at the top of pages that have drifted relative to their
English counterparts.

### Script help

For more details about the script, run `npm run check:i18n -- -h`.

## New localizations

To start a new localization for the OpenTelemetry website,
[raise an issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/) to
share your interest to contribute. Tag all other individuals that are willing to
write and review translations in the language you want to add. **You need at
least two potential contributors**, ideally three. Include the following task
list in your issue as well:

```markdown
- [ ] Contributors for the new language: @GITHUB_HANDLE1, @GITHUB_HANDLE2, ...
- [ ] Localize site homepage to YOUR_LANGUAGE_NAME
- [ ] Create an issue label for `lang:LANG_ID`
- [ ] Create org-level group for `LANG_ID` approvers
- [ ] Update components owners for `content/LANG_ID`
- [ ] Set up spell checking, if a cSpell dictionary is available
```

Notes:

- For `LANG_ID`, use an official
  [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) for the language you
  want to add.
- Look for
  [cSpell dictionaries](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts)
  available as NPM packages
  [@cspell/dict-LANG_ID](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40cspell%2Fdict). If a
  dictionary isn't available for your dialect or region, choose the closest
  region. For an example of how to set this up, see [PR #5386].

After you created that issue and have the required amount of contributors,
maintainers will ask you to provide a pull request with a translation of the
[index page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/blob/main/content/en/_index.md).
Make sure that maintainers are allowed to edit your PR, since they will add
additional changes to your PR that are required to get your localization project
started.

With your first PR merged maintainers will take care of setting up the issue
label, the org-level group and the component owners.

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}

You don't have to be an existing contributor to the OpenTelemetry project, to
start a new localization. However you will not be added as a member of the
[OpenTelemetry GitHub organization](https://github.com/open-telemetry/) or as a
member of the approvers group for your localization. You will need to satisfy
the requirements for becoming an established member and approver as outlined in
the
[membership guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md).

When starting the localization project, maintainers will treat your reviews as
if you are an approver already.

## English-language maintainer guidance

### When link checking fails for non-English pages

English is the default language of the OpenTelemetry website. After you add,
edit, or reorganized English language documentation, link checking may fail for
non-English pages. When this happens:

<!-- markdownlint-disable blanks-around-fences -->

- Do **not** fix the broken links. Each non-English page is associated with a
  specific commit of the corresponding English page, as identified by the git
  commit hash value of the `default_lang_commit` front matter key.
- Configure the link checker to ignore the non-English pages by adding the
  following to the page's front matter, or to the closest common ancestor file,
  when more than one page has link errors:
  ```yaml
  htmltest:
    # TODO: remove the IgnoreDirs once broken links are fixed
    IgnoreDirs:
      - path-regex/to/non-en/directory/contain/files/to/ignore
      - path-2-etc
  ```
- Run `npm run check:links` and include any updates to the `.htmltest.yml`
  config file with your PR.
