[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open source system for automated
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become
a widely-adopted, industry tool, leading to an increased need for observability
tooling. In response, OpenTelemetry has created many different tools to help
Kubernetes users observe their clusters and services.
