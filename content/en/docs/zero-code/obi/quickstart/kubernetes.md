Kubernetes is fully integrated into the OBI operation mode.

On one side, metrics and traces can be decorated with the metadata of the
Kubernetes entities running the automatically instrumented services.

On the other side, DaemonSet has become the preferred deployment mode for OBI:
thanks to the versatility of the new service selectors, a user can precisely
define which services need to be instrumented and which don't. A single instance
of OBI will be able to instrument the selected group of services within a single
Kubernetes node.

## OBI service selectors

A service selector is a set of properties that let OBI to query which processes
need to be instrumented.

When OBI is deployed as a regular operating system process that instrument other
processes, the unique service selectors are the network port where the
instrumented process should be listening to (can be specified with the
`OTEL_EBPF_OPEN_PORT` environment variable) or a
[Glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) to match against the
executable filename of the process to instrument (`OTEL_EBPF_AUTO_TARGET_EXE`
environment variable).

To select multiple groups of processes, the OBI YAML configuration file format
provides a `discovery.instrument` section that accepts multiple selector groups:

```yaml
discovery:
  instrument:
    # Instrument any process using the ports from 8080 to 8089
    - open_ports: 8080-8089
    # Instrument any process whose command line path contains "http"
    - exe_path: '*http*'
    # Instrument any process with a command line path containing "nginx"
    # and using the port 443 (both conditions must be fulfilled)
    - open_ports: 443
      exe_path: '*nginx*'
```

The above criteria are insufficient for Kubernetes pods where the ports are
ephemeral and internal to the pods. Also, pods are a level of abstraction that
should hide details such as the name of their executables. For that reason, OBI
makes it possible to use Kubernetes attributes in the service instrumentation
selection criteria. All of them accept a
[glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) as value:

- `k8s_namespace`: only instrument applications in the namespace matching the
  provided glob.
- `k8s_deployment_name`: only instrument Pods that belong to a Deployment with a
  name matching the provided glob.
- `k8s_replicaset_name`: only instrument Pods that belong to a ReplicaSet with a
  name matching the provided glob.
- `k8s_pod_name`: only instrument Pods with a name matching the provided glob.

## Example scenario

### 1. Deploy testing instrumentable services

You can instrument any HTTP or HTTPS service in your Kubernetes cluster. If you
prefer, you can first try instrumenting the dummy services provided in this
example.

The following Kubernetes example file contains two Apache HTTP servers: one
pretends to be a company `website` and the other pretends to be a documentation
site (`docs`). Let's ignore that both servers will just return an "It Works!"
string when the root directory is requested and a 404 error if any other path is
requested.

Copy the following contents into a file (for example, `sampleapps.yml`) and
deploy it with the command `kubectl apply -f sampleapps.yml`.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: docs
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: docs
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: docs
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: docs-server
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
              name: http
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: docs
spec:
  selector:
    app: docs
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: website
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: website
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: website
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: website-server
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
              name: http
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: website
spec:
  selector:
    app: website
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

To test that they are up and running, open two terminal sessions and run one of
each command below on a different session:

```shell
# Redirect website to local port 8080
kubectl port-forward services/website 8080:80

# Redirect docs site to local port 8081
kubectl port-forward services/docs 8081:80
```

From your computer, each request to `http://localhost:8080` will be a
hypothetical request to the company website and each request to
`http://localhost:8081` will be a hypothetical request to the documentation
website.

### 2. Create `obi` namespace

Before configuring and deploying OBI, let's create a `obi` namespace. We will
group there all the permissions, configurations and deployments related to it:

```shell
kubectl create namespace obi
```

### 3. Configure and run OBI

Next, you need to provide OBI with permissions to watch and inspect the metadata
of the diverse Kubernetes resources that OBI's discovery mechanism requires. You
must create the following YAML file and apply it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  namespace: obi
  name: obi
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: obi
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['apps']
    resources: ['replicasets']
    verbs: ['list', 'watch']
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['pods', 'services', 'nodes']
    verbs: ['list', 'watch']
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: obi
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: obi
    namespace: obi
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: obi
```

And now, deploy OBI by creating the following Kubernetes entities:

- A `ConfigMap` storing the `obi-config.yml` OBI configuration file, which
  defines the service discovery criteria. To verify that OBI is able to
  discriminate by service instance even if they run the same image and
  executable, OBI is configured to select ONLY the `docs` Apache web server.
- A OBI `DaemonSet` providing the OBI pod and its configuration:
  - Loads the `obi-config.yml` file from the `ConfigMap`, as specified in the
    `OTEL_EBPF_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
  - References to the `obi-secrets` values for the endpoint and credentials.
  - Uses the `obi` `ServiceAccount` to get all the permissions.

Copy and deploy the following YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: obi
  name: obi-config
data:
  obi-config.yml: |
    # this is required to enable kubernetes discovery and metadata
    attributes:
      kubernetes:
        enable: true
    # this will provide automatic routes report while minimizing cardinality
    routes:
      unmatched: heuristic
    # let's instrument only the docs server
    discovery:
      instrument:
        - k8s_deployment_name: "docs"
        # uncomment the following line to also instrument the website server
        # - k8s_deployment_name: "website"
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  namespace: obi
  name: obi
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      instrumentation: obi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        instrumentation: obi
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: obi
      hostPID: true # mandatory!
      containers:
        - name: obi
          image: otel/ebpf-instrument:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          securityContext:
            privileged: true # mandatory!
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /config
              name: obi-config
            - mountPath: /var/run/obi
              name: var-run-obi
          env:
            - name: OTEL_EBPF_CONFIG_PATH
              value: '/config/obi-config.yml'
            - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
              value: "localhost:4317"
      volumes:
        - name: obi-config
          configMap:
            name: obi-config
        - name: var-run-obi
          emptyDir: {}
```

Also notice:

- To run in DaemonSet mode, OBI requires to have access to all the processes in
  the node. Then the OBI Pod requires to run with `hostPID: true`.
- The OBI container needs to run with `privileged: true`, as it requires to
  perform privileged actions such as loading BPF programs and creating BPF maps.
  For running OBI as `unprivileged` container, i.e. without the
  `privileged: true` option, visit the
  [Deploy OBI unprivileged](../setup/kubernetes.md#deploy-obi-unprivileged)
  guide.

### 4. Test your instrumented services and see the results in your observability solution

With the `kubectl port-forward` commands from the firs step still running, test
both web server instances. For example:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/foo
curl http://localhost:8081
curl http://localhost:8081/foo
```

Some requests will return 404 error, but it's OK because they are also
instrumented.

Now, go to your observability UI. For example, Grafana, and select the data source
for the traces.

![Select the traces data source](img/select-traces.png)

To search for all the traces, select the **Search** box in the Query bar, leave
the form empty, and click **Run query**:

![Searching for all the traces in the system](img/run-query.png)

This will show the traces for the `docs` instance (port 8081). You might see
traces from your own services, but shouldn't see traces from the `website`
service, as it has not been instrumented by OBI.

![List of traces](img/tut-traces-list.png)

In the trace details, the resource attributes of the traces are decorated with
the metadata of the Kubernetes Pod running the instrumented service:
