You can configure OBI by setting [export modes](export-modes/), global
properties, and component options.

For information on the metrics OBI exports, refer to the
[exported metrics](../metrics/) documentation.

Refer to the [routes decorator](routes-decorator/) documentation to configure
the low cardinality routes decorator. It's very important for optimal results.
