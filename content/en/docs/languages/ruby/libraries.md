When you develop an app, you make use of third-party libraries and frameworks to
accelerate your work and to not reinvent the wheel. If you now instrument your
app with OpenTelemetry, you don't want to spend additional time on manually
adding traces, logs and metrics to those libraries and frameworks. Fortunately,
you don't have to reinvent the wheel for those either: libraries might come with
OpenTelemetry support natively or you can use an
[Instrumentation Library](/docs/concepts/instrumentation/libraries/) in order to
generate telemetry data for a library or framework.

If you are instrumenting an app, you can learn on this page how to make use of
natively instrumented libraries and Instrumentation Libraries for your
dependencies.

## Use natively instrumented libraries

If a library comes with OpenTelemetry out of the box, you get the traces,
metrics and logs emitted from that library, by adding and setting up the
OpenTelemetry SDK with your app.

The library may provide some additional configuration for the instrumentation.
Go to the documentation of that library to learn more.

As of today, we don't know about any Ruby library that has OpenTelemetry
natively integrated. If you know about such a library,
[let us know](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/new).

## Use Instrumentation Libraries

If a library does not come with OpenTelemetry out of the box, you can use
[instrumentation libraries](/docs/specs/otel/glossary/#instrumentation-library)
in order to generate telemetry data for a library or framework.

For example, if you are using Rails and enable
[`opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails`](https://rubygems.org/gems/opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails/),
your running Rails app will automatically generate telemetry data for inbound
requests to your controllers.

### Configuring all instrumentation libraries

OpenTelemetry Ruby provides the metapackage
[`opentelemetry-instrumentation-all`](https://rubygems.org/gems/opentelemetry-instrumentation-all)
that bundles all ruby-based instrumentation libraries into a single package.
Itâ€™s a convenient way to add telemetry for all your libraries with minimal
effort:

```sh
gem 'opentelemetry-sdk'
gem 'opentelemetry-exporter-otlp'
gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-all'
```

and configure it early in your application lifecycle. See the example below
using a Rails initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/exporter/otlp'
require 'opentelemetry/instrumentation/all'
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.service_name = '<YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>'
  c.use_all() # enables all instrumentation!
end
```

This will install all instrumentation libraries and enable the ones that match
up to libraries you're using in your app.

### Overriding configuration for specific instrumentation libraries

If you are enabling all instrumentation but want to override the configuration
for a specific one, call `use_all` with a configuration map parameter, where the
key represents the library, and the value is its specific configuration
parameter.

For example, here's how you can install all instrumentations _except_ the
`Redis` instrumentation into your app:

```ruby
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/instrumentation/all'

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  config = {'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Redis' => { enabled: false }}
  c.use_all(config)
end
```

To override more instrumentation, add another entry in the `config` map.

### Configuring specific instrumentation libraries

If you prefer more selectively installing and using only specific
instrumentation libraries, you can do that too. For example, here's how to use
only `Sinatra` and `Faraday`, with `Faraday` being configured with an additional
configuration parameter.

First, install the specific instrumentation libraries you know you want to use:

```sh
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-sinatra
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-faraday
```

Then configure them:

```ruby
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'

# install all compatible instrumentation with default configuration
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Sinatra'
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Faraday', { opt: 'value' }
end
```

### Next steps

Instrumentation libraries are the easiest way to generate lots of useful
telemetry data about your Ruby apps. But they don't generate data specific to
your application's logic! To do that, you'll need to enrich the instrumentation
from instrumentation libraries with your own
[instrumentation code](../instrumentation).
