## Use Instrumentation Libraries

Each instrumentation library is a [crate](https://crates.io/).

For example, the
[instrumentation library for Actix Web](https://crates.io/crates/actix-web-opentelemetry)
will automatically create [spans](/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#spans) and
[metrics](/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/) based on the inbound HTTP requests.

For a list of available instrumentation libraries, see the
[registry](/ecosystem/registry/?language=rust&component=instrumentation).
