OpenTelemetry code [instrumentation][] is supported for the languages listed in
the [Statuses and Releases](#status-and-releases) table below. Unofficial
implementations for [other languages](/docs/languages/other) are available as
well. You can find them in the [registry](/ecosystem/registry/).

For Go, .NET, PHP, Python, Java and JavaScript you can use
[zero-code solutions](/docs/zero-code) to add instrumentation to your
application without code changes.

If you are using Kubernetes, you can use the [OpenTelemetry Operator for
Kubernetes][otel-op] to [inject these zero-code solutions][zero-code] into your
application.

## Status and Releases

The current status of the major functional components for OpenTelemetry is as
follows:

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}

Regardless of an API/SDK's status, if your instrumentation relies on [semantic
conventions] that are marked as [Experimental] in the [semantic conventions
specification], your data flow might be subject to **breaking changes**.

[Experimental]: /docs/specs/otel/document-status/
[semantic conventions specification]: /docs/specs/semconv/
