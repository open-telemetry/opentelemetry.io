[Sampling](/docs/concepts/sampling/) is a process that restricts the amount of spans that are generated by a system. The exact sampler you should use depends on your specific needs, but in general, you should make a decision at the start of a trace and allow the sampling decision to propagate to other services.

A Sampler can be set on the tracer provider using the `setSampler` method, as follows:

```java
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.SdkTracerProvider;
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.samplers.Sampler;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Configure the tracer provider with the desired sampler
    SdkTracerProvider tracerProvider = SdkTracerProvider.builder()
      .setSampler(Sampler.alwaysOn()) // Set to always sample traces
      // or
      .setSampler(Sampler.alwaysOff()) // Set to never sample traces
      // or
      .setSampler(Sampler.traceIdRatioBased(0.5)) // Set to sample a fraction of traces
      .build();
  }
}
```

`alwaysOn` and `alwaysOff` are self-explanatory values. `alwaysOn` means that every span is sampled, while alwaysOff means that no span is sampled. When you’re getting started, or in a development environment, use `alwaysOn`.

Other samplers include:

- `traceIdRatioBased`, which samples a fraction of spans, based on the fraction given to the sampler. If you set `0.5`, half of all the spans are sampled.
- `parentBased`, which uses the parent span to make sampling decisions, if present.
  By default, the tracer provider uses a parentBased sampler with the `alwaysOn` sampler.

When in a production environment, consider using the `parentBased` sampler with the `traceIdRatioBased` sampler.
