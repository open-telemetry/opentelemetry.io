Propagation is the mechanism that moves data between services and processes.
Although not limited to tracing, it is what allows traces to build causal
information about a system across services that are arbitrarily distributed
across process and network boundaries.

OpenTelemetry provides a text-based approach to propagate context to remote
services using the [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/)
HTTP headers.

## Automatic context propagation

Instrumentation libraries for popular Python frameworks and libraries, such as
Jinja2, Flask, Django, and Celery.propagate context across services for you.

Use instrumentation libraries to propagate context. Although it is possible to
propagate context manually, the Python auto-instrumentation and instrumentation
libraries are well-tested and easier to use.

## Manual context propagation

The following generic example shows how you can propagate trace context
manually.

First, on the sending service, inject the current `context`:

```python
from flask import Flask
import requests
from opentelemetry import trace, baggage
from opentelemetry.trace.propagation.tracecontext import TraceContextTextMapPropagator
from opentelemetry.baggage.propagation import W3CBaggagePropagator
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, BatchSpanProcessor

app = Flask(__name__)

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter()))

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("api1_span") as span:
        ctx = baggage.set_baggage("hello", "world")

        headers = {}
        W3CBaggagePropagator().inject(headers, ctx)
        TraceContextTextMapPropagator().inject(headers, ctx)
        print(headers)

        response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:5001/', headers=headers)
        return f"Hello from API 1! Response from API 2: {response.text}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5002)
```

On the receiving service, extract `context`, for example, from parsed HTTP
headers, and then set them as the current trace context.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from opentelemetry import trace, baggage
from opentelemetry.trace.propagation.tracecontext import TraceContextTextMapPropagator
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter, BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.baggage.propagation import W3CBaggagePropagator

app = Flask(__name__)

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter()))

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    # Example: Log headers received in the request in API 2
    headers = dict(request.headers)
    print(f"Received headers: {headers}")
    carrier ={'traceparent': headers['Traceparent']}
    ctx = TraceContextTextMapPropagator().extract(carrier=carrier)
    print(f"Received context: {ctx}")

    b2 ={'baggage': headers['Baggage']}
    ctx2 = W3CBaggagePropagator().extract(b2, context=ctx)
    print(f"Received context2: {ctx2}")

    # Start a new span
    with tracer.start_span("api2_span", context=ctx2):
       # Use propagated context
        print(baggage.get_baggage('hello', ctx2))
        return "Hello from API 2!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)
```

From there, when you have a deserialized active context, you can create spans
that are part of the same trace from the other service.

### sqlcommenter

Some Python instrumentations support sqlcommenter, which enriches database query
statements with contextual information. Queries made with sqlcommenter enabled
will have configurable key-value pairs appended to them. For example:

```sql
"select * from auth_users; /*traceparent=00-01234567-abcd-01*/"
```

This supports context propagation between database client and server when
database log records are enabled. For more information, see:
