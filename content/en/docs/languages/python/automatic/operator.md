If you run your Python service in Kubernetes, you can take advantage of the
[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator)
to inject auto-instrumentation without having to modify each of your services
directly.
[See the OpenTelemetry Operator Auto-instrumentation docs for more details.](/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/)
