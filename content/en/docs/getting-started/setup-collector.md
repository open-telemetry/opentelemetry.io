In this section you will learn how you can setup common receivers, processors,
connectors and exporters of the OpenTelemetry Collector. You will use the OTLP
receiver to capture data from your application, then transform it using the
transform processor and finally export the telemetry to the console or to an
OTLP compatible backend that can visualize your telemetry.
