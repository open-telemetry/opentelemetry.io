OpenTelemetry can help you! To accomplish your goals of having your
dependencies instrumented automatically and instrumenting your own code with our
API manually, we recommend that you learn the following concepts first:

- [What is OpenTelemetry?](/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry/)
- [How can I instrument dependencies without touching their code?](/docs/concepts/instrumenting/#automatic-instrumentation)
- [How can I instrument my application manually?](/docs/concepts/instrumenting/#manual-instrumentation)

If you develop libraries, frameworks or middleware that is used as a dependency
within other software, we recommend that you learn how you can provide telemetry
natively:

- [How can I add native instrumentation to my library?](/docs/concepts/instrumenting-library/)

Next, you can deep dive into the documentations for the language you are using:

- [C++](/docs/instrumentation/cpp/)
- [.NET](/docs/instrumentation/net/)
- [Erlang / Elixir](/docs/instrumentation/erlang/)
- [Go](/docs/instrumentation/go/)
- [Java](/docs/instrumentation/java/)
- [JavaScript / TypeScript](/docs/instrumentation/js/)
- [PHP](/docs/instrumentation/php/)
- [Python](/docs/instrumentation/python/)
- [Ruby](/docs/instrumentation/ruby/)
- [Rust](/docs/instrumentation/rust/)
- [Swift](/docs/instrumentation/swift/)
