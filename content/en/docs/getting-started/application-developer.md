  I write code for my organization's apps and services. My goal is to get
  observability for my application by writing code. I want to have my
  dependencies emit telemetry for me automatically, and then use APIs to
  manually instrument important areas of my code.

OpenTelemetry can help you with that! To accomplish your goals of having your
dependencies instrumented automatically and instrumenting your own code with our
API manually, we recommend that you learn the following concepts first:

- [What is OpenTelemetry?](/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry/)
- [How can I instrument dependencies without touching their code?](/docs/concepts/instrumenting/#automatic-instrumentation)
- [How can I instrument my application manually?](/docs/concepts/instrumenting/#manual-instrumentation)

Next, you can deep dive into the documentations for the language you are using:

- [C++](/docs/instrumentation/cpp/)
- [.NET](/docs/instrumentation/net/)
- [Erlang / Elixir](/docs/instrumentation/erlang/)
- [Go](/docs/instrumentation/go/)
- [Java](/docs/instrumentation/java/)
- [JavaScript / TypeScript](/docs/instrumentation/js/)
- [PHP](/docs/instrumentation/php/)
- [Python](/docs/instrumentation/python/)
- [Ruby](/docs/instrumentation/ruby/)
- [Rust](/docs/instrumentation/rust/)
- [Swift](/docs/instrumentation/swift/)
