OpenTelemetry can help you with that! To accomplish your goal of providing
telemetry for your library natively, we recommend that you learn the following:

- [What is OpenTelemetry?](/docs/concepts/what-is-opentelemetry/).
- [How can I instrument my code manually?](/docs/concepts/instrumenting/#manual-instrumentation)
- [How can I add native instrumentation to my library?](http://localhost:8888/docs/concepts/instrumenting-library/)

Next, you can deep dive into the documentations for the language you are using:

- [C++](/docs/instrumentation/cpp/)
- [.NET](/docs/instrumentation/net/)
- [Erlang / Elixir](/docs/instrumentation/erlang/)
- [Go](/docs/instrumentation/go/)
- [Java](/docs/instrumentation/java/)
- [JavaScript / TypeScript](/docs/instrumentation/js/)
- [PHP](/docs/instrumentation/php/)
- [Python](/docs/instrumentation/python/)
- [Ruby](/docs/instrumentation/ruby/)
- [Rust](/docs/instrumentation/rust/)
- [Swift](/docs/instrumentation/swift/)
