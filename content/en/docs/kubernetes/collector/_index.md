## Introduction

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/collector) is a vendor-agnostic way to
receive, process and export telemetry data. Although the Collector can be used
many places, this documentation will focus on how to use the Collector to
monitor Kubernetes and the services running on Kubernetes. For more general
Collector documentation, such as configuration and troubleshooting see the
[collector docs](/docs/collector).
