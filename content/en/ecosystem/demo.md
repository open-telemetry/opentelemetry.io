The [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo)
does the following:

- Provides a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
- Builds a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
- Creates a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.

If you find yourself asking questions like:

- How should I use the SDK for my language?
- What's the best way to use OpenTelemetry APIs?
- How should my services be configured?
- How should my OpenTelemetry Collector be configured?
- How do I consider the
  [architecture](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/architecture/)
  of a system using OpenTelemetry?

Then check out the [Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo).
