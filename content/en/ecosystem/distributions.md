  List of open source OpenTelemetry distributions maintained by third parties.

OpenTelemetry [distributions](/docs/concepts/distributions/) are a way of
customizing OpenTelemetry components so that they're easier to deploy and use
with specific observability backends.

Any third-party can customize OpenTelemetry components with backend, vendor, or
end-user specific changes. You don't have to use a distributions in order to use
OpenTelemetry components, though distributions might facilitate usage under
certain circumstances, such as specific vendor requirements.

The following list contains a sample of OpenTelemetry distributions and the
component they customize.

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}} OpenTelemetry **does not validate or

## How to add your distribution {#how-to-add}

To have your distribution listed, submit a PR with an entry added to the
[distributions list](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/data/ecosystem/distributions.yaml).
The entry should include the following:

- Link to the main page of your distribution
- Link to the documentation that explains how to use the distribution
- List the components your distribution contains
- GitHub handle or email address as a point of contact so that we can reach out
  in case we have questions

- If you provide external integration of OpenTelemetry for any kind of library,
  service, or app, then consider
  [adding it to the registry](/ecosystem/registry/adding).
- If you adopt OpenTelemetry for observability as an end user and do not provide
  any kind of services around OpenTelemetry, see
  [Adopters](/ecosystem/adopters).
- If you provide a solution that consumes OpenTelemetry to offer observability
  to end users, see [Vendors](/ecosystem/vendors).
