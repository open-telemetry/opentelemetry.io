A non-exhaustive list of libraries, services or apps which integrate
OpenTelemetry **natively** to emit traces, metrics and logs.

{{% ecosystem/integrations-table %}}

To have a library, service or app listed,
[add an entry to the list](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/data/ecosystem/integrations.yaml)
and submit a PR.

You will need to include a link to the documentation that explains how
OpenTelemetry is used to enable observability.

Note, that this list is for libraries, services or apps which integrate
OpenTelemetry **natively**.

If you provide external integration of OpenTelemetry for any kind of library,
service or app, [add it to the registry](/ecosystem/registry/adding) <br /> If you adopt
OpenTelemetry for Observability as an end user and do not provide any kind of
services around OpenTelemetry, see [Adopters](/ecosystem/adopters). <br /> If you provide
a solution that consumes OpenTelemetry to offer Observability to end users, see
[Vendors](/ecosystem/vendors).
