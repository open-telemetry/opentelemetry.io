A non-exhaustive list of libraries, services and apps that integrate
OpenTelemetry **natively** to emit traces, metrics and logs.

{{% ecosystem/integrations-table %}}

To have your library, service, or app listed, submit a PR with an entry added to
the
[integrations list](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/data/ecosystem/integrations.yaml).
The entry must include the following:

- Link to the main page of your library, service, or app
- Link to the documentation that explains how enable observability using
  OpenTelemetry

Note that this list is for libraries, services, and apps that integrate
OpenTelemetry **natively**.

If you provide external integration of OpenTelemetry for any kind of library,
service, or app, then [add it to the registry](/ecosystem/registry/adding).

If you adopt OpenTelemetry for Observability as an end user and do not provide
any kind of services around OpenTelemetry, see [Adopters](/ecosystem/adopters).

If you provide a solution that consumes OpenTelemetry to offer Observability to
end users, see [Vendors](/ecosystem/vendors).
