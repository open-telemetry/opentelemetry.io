A non-exhaustive list of libraries, services and apps that integrate
OpenTelemetry **natively** to emit traces, metrics and logs.

{{% ecosystem/integrations-table %}}

To have your library, service or app listed, submit a PR with an entry added to
the
[integrations list](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/data/ecosystem/integrations.yaml).
The entry must include the following:

- a link to the main page of your library, service or app.
- a link to the documentation that explains how OpenTelemetry is used to enable
  observability.

Note, that this list is for libraries, services or apps which integrate
OpenTelemetry **natively**.

If you provide external integration of OpenTelemetry for any kind of library,
service or app, [add it to the registry](/ecosystem/registry/adding) <br /> If
you adopt OpenTelemetry for Observability as an end user and do not provide any
kind of services around OpenTelemetry, see [Adopters](/ecosystem/adopters).
<br /> If you provide a solution that consumes OpenTelemetry to offer
Observability to end users, see [Vendors](/ecosystem/vendors).
