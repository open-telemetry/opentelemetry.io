Do you maintain or contribute to an integration for OpenTelemetry? We'd love to
feature your project in the [registry](../)!

To add your project, submit a [pull request][]. You'll need to create a data
file in [data/registry][] for your project, by using the following template:
[registry-entry.yml][].

Make sure that your project names and descriptions follow our [marketing
guidelines][] and are in line with the Linux Foundationâ€™s branding and
[trademark usage guidelines][].
