Do you maintain or contribute to an integration for OpenTelemetry? We'd love to
feature your project in the [registry](../)!

To add your project, submit a [pull request][]. You'll need to create a data
file in [data/registry][] for your project, by using the following template:
[registry-entry.yml][].

[data/registry]:
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/data/registry
[pull request]:
  https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
[registry-entry.yml]:
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/tree/main/templates/registry-entry.yml
