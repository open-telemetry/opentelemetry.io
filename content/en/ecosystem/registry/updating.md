title: Keeping registry and list information current
linkTitle: Updating
---

We periodically review [registry](..) entry and [list data], such as external
links, to ensure that only [adopters](../../adopters/),
[distributions](../../distributions/),
[integrations, libraries](../../integrations/), and [vendors](../../vendors/)
actively supporting OpenTelemetry are included in the registry.

Entry authors are encouraged to maintain links to active and up-to-date
distributions, documentation, and libraries. We reserve the right to update or
remove entries for components that seem to no longer actively support
OpenTelemetry. This may happen, for example, when external links become invalid.
We will attempt to contact the GitHub user who submitted the original entry data
on a best effort basis, but otherwise reserve the right to edit and remove
entries and entry data.
