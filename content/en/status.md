## {{% param title %}}

OpenTelemetry is made up of [several components][main-comp], some
language-specific and others language-agnostic. When looking for a status, make
sure to look for the status from the right component page. For example, the
status of a signal in the specification may not be the same as the signal status
in a particular language SDK.

For the development status, or maturity level, of a
[language SDK](/docs/languages/), see the status section of that language:

<div class="l-status-secondary mt-0">

For the development status, or maturity level, of the
[collector](/docs/collector/) and [specification](/docs/specs/otel/), see the
following:

<div class="l-status-primary mt-0">
