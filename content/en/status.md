OpenTelemetry is made up of several components, each having different meanings
for "status". For example, the status of a signal in the specification may not
be the same as its status in a particular language SDK.

The development status, or maturity level, of the [per-language
SDKs](/docs/instrumentation/) is as follows:

<div class="l-primary-buttons mt-5">

- [C++](/docs/instrumentation/cpp/#status-and-releases) 
- [.NET](/docs/instrumentation/net/#status-and-releases) 
- [Erlang/Elixir](/docs/instrumentation/erlang/#status-and-releases) 
- [Go](/docs/instrumentation/go/#status-and-releases) 
- [Java](/docs/instrumentation/java/#status-and-releases) 
- [JavaScript](/docs/instrumentation/js/#status-and-releases) 
- [PHP](/docs/instrumentation/php/#status-and-releases) 
- [Python](/docs/instrumentation/python/#status-and-releases) 
- [Ruby](/docs/instrumentation/ruby/#status-and-releases) 
- [Rust](/docs/instrumentation/rust/#status-and-releases) 
- [Swift](/docs/instrumentation/swift/#status-and-releases) 

</div>

The development status, or maturity level, of the [language-agnostic
components][main-comp] are as follows:


<div class="l-primary-buttons mt-5">

- [Specification status](/docs/reference/specification/status/)
- [Collector status](/docs/collector/#status-and-releases)

</div>
