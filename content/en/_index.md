OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. Use it to instrument,
generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help
you analyze your software's performance and behavior.

> OpenTelemetry is [generally available](/status/) across
> [several languages](docs/languages/) and is suitable for production use.
