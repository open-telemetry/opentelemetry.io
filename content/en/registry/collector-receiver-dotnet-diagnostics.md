description: The Dotnet Diagnostics Receiver for the OpenTelemetry Collector provides a capability similar to the dotnet-counters tool, which takes a .NET process ID and reads metrics from that process, providing them to the CLI. Similarly, this receiver reads metrics from a given .NET process, translating them and providing them to the Collector.
